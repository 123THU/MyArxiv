In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.","authors":["Nikhil Chandak","Shashwat Goel","Ameya Prabhu","Moritz Hardt","Jonas Geiping"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"45 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26745v2","updated":"2025-12-31T18:57:25Z","published":"2025-10-30T17:40:22Z","title":"Deep sequence models tend to memorize geometrically; it is unclear why","summary":"Deep sequence models are said to store atomic facts predominantly in the form of associative memory: a brute-force lookup of co-occurring entities. We identify a dramatically different form of storage of atomic facts that we term as geometric memory. Here, the model has synthesized embeddings encoding novel global relationships between all entities, including ones that do not co-occur in training. Such storage is powerful: for instance, we show how it transforms a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition into an easy-to-learn $1$-step navigation task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry, as against a lookup of local associations, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical supervisory, architectural, or optimizational pressures. Counterintuitively, a geometry is learned even when it is more complex than the brute-force lookup.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also points out to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery, and unlearning.","authors":["Shahriar Noroozizadeh","Vaishnavh Nagarajan","Elan Rosenfeld","Sanjiv Kumar"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25063v1","updated":"2025-12-31T18:56:02Z","published":"2025-12-31T18:56:02Z","title":"Many Minds from One Model: Bayesian Transformers for Population Intelligence","summary":"Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.\n  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.","authors":["Diji Yang","Yi Zhang"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25052v1","updated":"2025-12-31T18:48:07Z","published":"2025-12-31T18:48:07Z","title":"AdaGReS:Adaptive Greedy Context Selection via Redundancy-Aware Scoring for Token-Budgeted RAG","summary":"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation.

Recent semantic parsers have been developed with sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) pre-trained language models (PLMs) or large language models, where the models treat logical forms as sequences of tokens. For syntactic and semantic validity, the semantic parsers use grammars that enable constrained decoding. However, the grammars lack the ability to utilize large information of KBs, although logical forms contain representations of KB elements, such as entities or relations. In this work, we propose a grammar augmented with candidate expressions for semantic parsing on a large KB with a seq2seq PLM. The grammar defines actions as production rules, and our semantic parser predicts actions during inference under the constraints by types and candidate expressions. We apply the grammar to knowledge base question answering, where the constraints by candidate expressions assist a semantic parser to generate valid KB elements. We also introduce two special rules, sub-type inference and union types, and a mask caching algorithm. In particular, sub-type inference and the mask caching algorithm greatly increase the decoding speed of our semantic parser. We experimented on two benchmarks, KQA Pro and Overnight, where the constraints by candidate expressions increased the accuracy of our semantic parser, whether it was trained with strong supervision or weak supervision. In addition, our semantic parser had a fast decoding speed in the experiments.

Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level \"thought\" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.","authors":["Nasim Borazjanizadeh","James McClelland"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25015v1","updated":"2025-12-31T18:06:21Z","published":"2025-12-31T18:06:21Z","title":"MAMA-Memeia!

A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually.

The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.","authors":["Augusto B.

This article argues that vibe coding is best understood as interface flattening, a reconfiguration in which previously distinct modalities (GUI, CLI, and API) appear to converge into a single conversational surface, even as the underlying chain of translation from intention to machinic effect lengthens and thickens. Drawing on Friedrich Kittler's materialist media theory and Alexander Galloway's account of interfaces as sites of protocol control, the paper situates programming as a historically localised interface arrangement rather than an essential relation to computation. Through a materialist reconstruction of the contemporary vibe-coding stack, it shows how remote compute infrastructures, latency and connectivity, structured outputs, function/tool calling, and interoperability standards such as the Model Context Protocol relocate control and meaning-making power to model and protocol providers. The apparent democratisation of technical capability therefore depends on new dependencies and new literacies. By foregrounding the tension between experiential flattening and infrastructural thickening, I demonstrate how LLM-mediated development redistributes symbolic labour/power, obscures responsibility, and privatises competencies previously dispersed across programming communities, contributing a critical lens on the political economy of AI-mediated human-computer interaction.","authors":["Hongrui Jin"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"16 pages, 1 figure"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24933v1","updated":"2025-12-31T15:46:37Z","published":"2025-12-31T15:46:37Z","title":"Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization Framework for Multi-Step LLM Pipeline","summary":"Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step.

We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources.

However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power.

However, the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce MedQARo, the first large-scale medical QA benchmark in Romanian, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). We construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 105,880 QA pairs related to cancer patients from two medical centers. The questions regard medical case summaries of 1,242 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered correctly. MedQARo is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who spent a total of about 3,000 work hours to generate the QA pairs. Our benchmark contains both in-domain and cross-domain (cross-center and cross-cancer) test collections, enabling a precise assessment of generalization capabilities. We experiment with four open-source LLMs from distinct families of models on MedQARo. Each model is employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one based on supervised fine-tuning. We also evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs exposed only through APIs, namely GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Flash.

Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis.

Despite decades of work, evaluation practice remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics. Modern large language model (LLM) based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond fixed context windows. In such systems, unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.\n  This paper introduces an evaluation framework that reports boundary density and segment alignment diagnostics (purity and coverage) alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). By separating boundary scoring from boundary selection, we evaluate segmentation quality across density regimes rather than at a single operating point. Cross-dataset evaluation shows that reported performance differences often reflect annotation granularity mismatch rather than boundary placement quality alone.\n  We evaluate structurally distinct segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Boundary-based metrics are strongly coupled to boundary density: threshold sweeps produce larger W-F1 changes than switching between methods. These findings support viewing topic segmentation as a granularity selection problem rather than prediction of a single correct boundary set. This motivates separating boundary scoring from boundary selection for analyzing and tuning segmentation under varying annotation granularities.","authors":["Michael H.

Traditional methods use classical probability to calculate the likelihood of an image matching each gloss of the target word, summing these to form a posterior probability. However, due to the challenge of semantic uncertainty, glosses from different sources inevitably carry semantic biases, which can lead to biased disambiguation results. Inspired by quantum superposition in modeling uncertainty, this paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD). It encodes multiple glosses of the target word into a superposition state to mitigate semantic biases. Then, the quantum circuit is executed, and the results are observed. By formalizing our method, we find that Q-VWSD is a quantum generalization of the method based on classical probability. Building on this, we further designed a heuristic version of Q-VWSD that can run more efficiently on classical computing. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art classical methods, particularly by effectively leveraging non-specialized glosses from large language models, which further enhances performance.

All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making.

Specifically, we first propose a new taxonomic approach that exhaustively discusses existing model merging methods. Secondly, we discuss the application of model merging techniques in large language models, multimodal large language models, and more than ten machine learning subfields, including continual learning, multi-task learning, few-shot learning, etc. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges of model merging and discuss future research directions.

In this study, we investigate the impact of content position and input size on text embeddings. Our experiments reveal that embedding models, irrespective of their positional encoding mechanisms, disproportionately prioritize the beginning of an input. Ablation studies demonstrate that insertion of irrelevant text or removal at the start of a document reduces cosine similarity between altered and original embeddings by up to 12.3% more than ablations at the end. Regression analysis further confirms this bias, with sentence importance declining as position moves further from the start, even with with content-agnosticity.

While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.","authors":["Zhenyu Zhang","Xiaoxia Wu","Zhongzhu Zhou","Qingyang Wu","Yineng Zhang","Pragaash Ponnusamy","Harikaran Subbaraj","Jue Wang","Shuaiwen Leon Song","Ben Athiwaratkun"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24572v1","updated":"2025-12-31T02:35:54Z","published":"2025-12-31T02:35:54Z","title":"Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark: Toward Knowledge-Independent Evaluation of LLMs' Legal Reasoning Capabilities","summary":"We introduce the Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark (KCL), a benchmark designed to assess language models' legal reasoning capabilities independently of domain-specific knowledge.

We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition.

This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the prevailing multilingual safety gap narrative. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a mechanism of Complex Interference where safety is determined by the intersection of variables. While models exhibited a Reverse Linguistic with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms.

JCB leverages successes from past behaviors to help jailbreak new behaviors, thereby significantly improving the attack efficiency.

Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch.

One of the primary factors behind the advancement of speech technology is self-supervised learning. Most self-supervised learning algorithms are designed with full utterance assumption and compromises have to made if partial utterances are presented, which are common in the streaming applications. In this work, we propose a chunk based self-supervised learning (Chunk SSL) algorithm as an unified solution for both streaming and offline speech pre-training. Chunk SSL is optimized with the masked prediction loss and an acoustic encoder is encouraged to restore indices of those masked speech frames with help from unmasked frames in the same chunk and preceding chunks. A copy and append data augmentation approach is proposed to conduct efficient chunk based pre-training. Chunk SSL utilizes a finite scalar quantization (FSQ) module to discretize input speech features and our study shows a high resolution FSQ codebook, i.e., a codebook with vocabulary size up to a few millions, is beneficial to transfer knowledge from the pre-training task to the downstream tasks. A group masked prediction loss is employed during pre-training to alleviate the high memory and computation cost introduced by the large codebook. The proposed approach is examined in two speech to text tasks, i.e., speech recognition and speech translation.

Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations.

Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity.

These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets.

However, conventional supervised learning requires high-quality, high-SNR references for network training, which are often difficult or impossible to obtain in different scenarios, particularly in low-field MRI. Self-supervised learning provides an alternative by removing the need for training references, but its reconstruction performance can degrade when the baseline SNR is low. To address these limitations, we propose hybrid learning, a two-stage training framework that integrates self-supervised and supervised learning for joint MRI reconstruction and denoising when only low-SNR training references are available. Hybrid learning is implemented in two sequential stages. In the first stage, self-supervised learning is applied to fully sampled low-SNR data to generate higher-quality pseudo-references. In the second stage, these pseudo-references are used as targets for supervised learning to reconstruct and denoise undersampled noisy data. The proposed technique was evaluated in multiple experiments involving simulated and real low-field MRI in the lung and brain at different field strengths. Hybrid learning consistently improved image quality over both standard self-supervised learning and supervised learning with noisy training references at different acceleration rates, noise levels, and field strengths, achieving higher SSIM and lower NMSE. The hybrid learning approach is effective for both Cartesian and non-Cartesian acquisitions. Hybrid learning provides an effective solution for training deep MRI reconstruction models in the absence of high-SNR references. By improving image quality in low-SNR settings, particularly for low-field MRI, it holds promise for broader clinical adoption of deep learning-based reconstruction methods.","authors":["Haoyang Pei","Nikola Janjuvsevic","Renqing Luo","Ding Xia","Xiang Xu","William Moore","Yao Wang","Hersh Chandarana","Li Feng"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25000v1","updated":"2025-12-31T17:50:05Z","published":"2025-12-31T17:50:05Z","title":"Bi-C2R: Bidirectional Continual Compatible Representation for Re-indexing Free Lifelong Person Re-identification","summary":"Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as \"re-indexing\". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.","authors":["Zhenyu Cui","Jiahuan Zhou","Yuxin Peng"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24986v1","updated":"2025-12-31T17:32:31Z","published":"2025-12-31T17:32:31Z","title":"PhysTalk: Language-driven Real-time Physics in 3D Gaussian Scenes","summary":"Realistic visual simulations are omnipresent, yet their creation requires computing time, rendering, and expert animation knowledge.

In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics.

While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects.

In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities.

CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.","authors":["Xinran Gong","Gorkem Durak","Halil Ertugrul Aktas","Vedat Cicek","Jinkui Hao","Ulas Bagci","Nilay S.

Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities.

Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.","authors":["Md Ahmed Al Muzaddid","Jordan A.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) models extract global descriptors using the powerful foundation model DINOv2 as backbone. These models either explore the cross-image correlation or propose a time-consuming two-stage re-ranking strategy to achieve better performance. However, existing works only utilize the final output of DINOv2, and the current cross-image correlation causes unstable retrieval results. To produce both discriminative and constant global descriptors, this paper proposes stable cross-image correlation enhanced model for VPR called SciceVPR. This model explores the full potential of DINOv2 in providing useful feature representations that implicitly encode valuable contextual knowledge. Specifically, SciceVPR first uses a multi-layer feature fusion module to capture increasingly detailed task-relevant channel and spatial information from the multi-layer output of DINOv2. Secondly, SciceVPR considers the invariant correlation between images within a batch as valuable knowledge to be distilled into the proposed self-enhanced encoder. In this way, SciceVPR can acquire fairly robust global features regardless of domain shifts (e.g., changes in illumination, weather and viewpoint between pictures taken in the same place). Experimental results demonstrate that the base variant, SciceVPR-B, outperforms SOTA one-stage methods with single input on multiple datasets with varying domain conditions. The large variant, SciceVPR-L, performs on par with SOTA two-stage models, scoring over 3% higher in Recall@1 compared to existing models on the challenging Tokyo24/7 dataset.

Object detectors identify and localize instances by assessing multiple visual features collectively. When generating explanations, overlooking these collective influences in detections may lead to missing compositional cues or capturing spurious correlations. However, existing methods typically focus solely on individual pixel contributions, neglecting the collective contribution of multiple pixels. To address this limitation, we propose a game-theoretic method based on Shapley values and interactions to explicitly capture both individual and collective pixel contributions.

This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.\n  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images.

In this study, we propose a novel three-stage compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels, significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to 13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from 26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.","authors":["Melika Sabaghian","Mohammad Ali Keyvanrad","Seyyedeh Mahila Moghadami"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"28 pages, 11 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23020v2","updated":"2025-12-31T10:56:28Z","published":"2025-12-28T17:44:20Z","title":"OpenGround: Active Cognition-based Reasoning for Open-World 3D Visual Grounding","summary":"3D visual grounding aims to locate objects based on natural language descriptions in 3D scenes.

To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories.

However, generating long sequences remains a significant challenge. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Models such as GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, typically up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. Classical approaches often result in degraded video quality when attempting to increase the generated video length, especially for significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, where each state represents a short-length VAE-GAN video generator.

Not only does the hand occlude much of the object, but also the object is often only visible in a small number of image pixels. At the same time, two strong anchors emerge in this setting: (1) estimated 3D hands help disambiguate the location and scale of the object, and (2) the set of manipulanda is small relative to all possible objects. With these insights in mind, we present a scalable paradigm for hand-held object reconstruction that builds on recent breakthroughs in large language/vision models and 3D object datasets. Given a monocular RGB video, we aim to reconstruct hand-held object geometry in 3D, over time. In order to obtain the best performing single frame model, we first present MCC-Hand-Object (MCC-HO), which jointly reconstructs hand and object geometry given a single RGB image and inferred 3D hand as inputs. Subsequently, we prompt a text-to-3D generative model using GPT-4(V) to retrieve a 3D object model that matches the object in the image(s); we call this alignment Retrieval-Augmented Reconstruction (RAR). RAR provides unified object geometry across all frames, and the result is rigidly aligned with both the input images and 3D MCC-HO observations in a temporally consistent manner. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on lab and Internet image/video datasets.

We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient X/G is not a submanifold of X and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non homeomorphic, discriminative target for example, supervision via labels, cross-instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand and snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.","authors":["Xiu Li"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24702v1","updated":"2025-12-31T08:10:03Z","published":"2025-12-31T08:10:03Z","title":"Evolving, Not Training: Zero-Shot Reasoning Segmentation via Evolutionary Prompting","summary":"Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass \"generate-then-segment\" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a \"Generate-Evaluate-Evolve\" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

Our approach addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a hierarchical latent warping strategy that maintains consistency across both keyframes and local frames, and a hybrid token merging mechanism that adaptively combines optical flow and feature matching. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only maintains the high-quality restoration of base diffusion models but also achieves superior temporal consistency across diverse datasets and degradation conditions, including challenging scenarios like 8$\\times$ super-resolution and severe noise.

However, existing deep learning (DL)-based approaches only restore one clean HSI from the given noisy HSI with a deterministic mapping, thus ignoring the ill-posed issue and always resulting in an over-smoothing problem. Additionally, these DL-based methods often neglect that noise is part of the high-frequency component and their network architectures fail to decouple the learning of low-frequency and high-frequency. To alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a flow-based HSI denoising network (HIDFlowNet) to directly learn the conditional distribution of the clean HSI given the noisy HSI and thus diverse clean HSIs can be sampled from the conditional distribution. Overall, our HIDFlowNet is induced from the generative flow model and is comprised of an invertible decoder and a conditional encoder, which can explicitly decouple the learning of low-frequency and high-frequency information of HSI. Specifically, the invertible decoder is built by staking a succession of invertible conditional blocks (ICBs) to capture the local high-frequency details. The conditional encoder utilizes down-sampling operations to obtain low-resolution images and uses transformers to capture correlations over a long distance so that global low-frequency information can be effectively extracted. Extensive experiments on simulated and real HSI datasets verify that our proposed HIDFlowNet can obtain better or comparable results compared with other state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Qizhou Wang","Li Pang","Xiangyong Cao","Zhiqiang Tian","Deyu Meng"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"29 pages, 8 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02261v3","updated":"2025-12-31T07:36:16Z","published":"2025-08-04T10:09:31Z","title":"SplatSSC: Decoupled Depth-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Semantic Scene Completion","summary":"Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene from a single image.

In this paper, we propose SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator.

Despite their success, VDMs still suffer from degraded image quality and flickering artifacts. To address these issues, some approaches have introduced preference learning to exploit human feedback to enhance the video generation. However, these methods primarily adopt the routine in the image domain without an in-depth investigation into video-specific preference optimization. In this paper, we reexamine the design of the video preference learning from two key aspects: feedback source and feedback tuning methodology, and present OnlineVPO, a more efficient preference learning framework tailored specifically for VDMs. On the feedback source, we found that the image-level reward model commonly used in existing methods fails to provide a human-aligned video preference signal due to the modality gap. In contrast, video quality assessment (VQA) models show superior alignment with human perception of video quality. Building on this insight, we propose leveraging VQA models as a proxy of humans to provide more modality-aligned feedback for VDMs. Regarding the preference tuning methodology, we introduce an online DPO algorithm tailored for VDMs. It not only enjoys the benefits of superior scalability in optimizing videos with higher resolution and longer duration compared with the existing method, but also mitigates the insufficient optimization issue caused by off-policy learning via online preference generation and curriculum preference update designs.

However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment.

Recent approaches typically leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings, our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4% and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively.

Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse.

Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named \"FireRescue\" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.","authors":["Qingyu Xu","Runtong Zhang","Zihuan Qiu","Fanman Meng"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24620v1","updated":"2025-12-31T04:25:53Z","published":"2025-12-31T04:25:53Z","title":"LLHA-Net: A Hierarchical Attention Network for Two-View Correspondence Learning","summary":"Establishing the correct correspondence of feature points is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, the presence of numerous outliers among the feature points can significantly affect the matching results, reducing the accuracy and robustness of the process. Furthermore, a challenge arises when dealing with a large proportion of outliers: how to ensure the extraction of high-quality information while reducing errors caused by negative samples. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

Existing SOP methods typically aggregate contextual features to assist the occupancy representation learning, alleviating issues like occlusion or ambiguity. However, these solutions often face misalignment issues wherein the corresponding features at the same position across different frames may have different semantic meanings during the aggregation process, which leads to unreliable contextual fusion results and an unstable representation learning process. To address this problem, we introduce a new Hierarchical context alignment paradigm for a more accurate SOP (Hi-SOP). Hi-SOP first disentangles the geometric and temporal context for separate alignment, which two branches are then composed to enhance the reliability of SOP. This parsing of the visual input into a local-global alignment hierarchy includes: (I) disentangled geometric and temporal separate alignment, within each leverages depth confidence and camera pose as prior for relevant feature matching respectively; (II) global alignment and composition of the transformed geometric and temporal volumes based on semantics consistency.

Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Zheng Liu","Jinchao Zhu","Gao Huang"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"13 tables, 3 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24593v1","updated":"2025-12-31T03:30:58Z","published":"2025-12-31T03:30:58Z","title":"3D Semantic Segmentation for Post-Disaster Assessment","summary":"The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses.

In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.","authors":["Wei Zhang","Chaoqun Wang","Zixuan Guan","Sam Kao","Pengfei Zhao","Peng Wu","Sifeng He"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24591v1","updated":"2025-12-31T03:28:17Z","published":"2025-12-31T03:28:17Z","title":"Improving Few-Shot Change Detection Visual Question Answering via Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning","summary":"Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision.

RAIR established a standardized framework for relevance assessment and provides a set of universal rules, which forms the foundation for standardized evaluation. Additionally, RAIR analyzes essential capabilities required for current relevance models and introduces a comprehensive dataset consists of three subset: (1) a general subset with industry-balanced sampling to evaluate fundamental model competencies; (2) a long-tail hard subset focus on challenging cases to assess performance limits; (3) a visual salience subset for evaluating multimodal understanding capabilities. We conducted experiments on RAIR using 14 open and closed-source models. The results demonstrate that RAIR presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance. RAIR data are now available, serving as an industry benchmark for relevance assessment while providing new insights into general LLM and Visual Language Model(VLM) evaluation.","authors":["Chenji Lu","Zhuo Chen","Hui Zhao","Zhenyi Wang","Pengjie Wang","Jian Xu","Bo Zheng"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22386v2","updated":"2025-12-31T14:32:49Z","published":"2025-12-26T21:13:59Z","title":"OxygenREC: An Instruction-Following Generative Framework for E-commerce Recommendation","summary":"Traditional recommendation systems suffer from inconsistency in multi-stage optimization objectives. Generative Recommendation (GR) mitigates them through an end-to-end framework; however, existing methods still rely on matching mechanisms based on inductive patterns. Although responsive, they lack the ability to uncover complex user intents that require deductive reasoning based on world knowledge. Meanwhile, LLMs show strong deep reasoning capabilities, but their latency and computational costs remain challenging for industrial applications. More critically, there are performance bottlenecks in multi-scenario scalability: as shown in Figure 1, existing solutions require independent training and deployment for each scenario, leading to low resource utilization and high maintenance costs-a challenge unaddressed in GR literature. To address these, we present OxygenREC, an industrial recommendation system that leverages Fast-Slow Thinking to deliver deep reasoning with strict latency and multi-scenario requirements of real-world environments. First, we adopt a Fast-Slow Thinking architecture. Slow thinking uses a near-line LLM pipeline to synthesize Contextual Reasoning Instructions, while fast thinking employs a high-efficiency encoder-decoder backbone for real-time generation. Second, to ensure reasoning instructions effectively enhance recommendation generation, we introduce a semantic alignment mechanism with Instruction-Guided Retrieval (IGR) to filter intent-relevant historical behaviors and use a Query-to-Item (Q2I) loss for instruction-item consistency. Finally, to resolve multi-scenario scalability, we transform scenario information into controllable instructions, using unified reward mapping and Soft Adaptive Group Clip Policy Optimization (SA-GCPO) to align policies with diverse business objectives, realizing a train-once-deploy-everywhere paradigm.","authors":["Xuegang Hao","Ming Zhang","Alex Li","Xiangyu Qian","Zhi Ma","Yanlong Zang","Shijie Yang","Zhongxuan Han","Xiaolong Ma","Jinguang Liu","Zhen Li","Zhida Jiang","Shusheng Wang","Ning Tang","Yanchen Qiao","Chenxiang Yang","Chen Sun","Jincheng Yuan","Chunhua Peng","Heng Hu","Peijun Yang","Baopeng Yuan","Caiyun Qiu","Zhaolong Xing","Haofei Yuan","Haipeng Zhang","Yuzhang Guo","Weijie Ding","Jiahua Gao","Hao Huang","Zhen Chen","Tongxuan Liu","Pinghua Gong"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"37 pages, 7 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24787v1","updated":"2025-12-31T11:16:24Z","published":"2025-12-31T11:16:24Z","title":"HiGR: Efficient Generative Slate Recommendation via Hierarchical Planning and Multi-Objective Preference Alignment","summary":"Slate recommendation, where users are presented with a ranked list of items simultaneously, is widely adopted in online platforms. Recent advances in generative models have shown promise in slate recommendation by modeling sequences of discrete semantic IDs autoregressively. However, existing autoregressive approaches suffer from semantically entangled item tokenization and inefficient sequential decoding that lacks holistic slate planning. To address these limitations, we propose HiGR, an efficient generative slate recommendation framework that integrates hierarchical planning with listwise preference alignment. First, we propose an auto-encoder utilizing residual quantization and contrastive constraints to tokenize items into semantically structured IDs for controllable generation. Second, HiGR decouples generation into a list-level planning stage for global slate intent, followed by an item-level decoding stage for specific item selection. Third, we introduce a listwise preference alignment objective to directly optimize slate quality using implicit user feedback. Experiments on our large-scale commercial media platform demonstrate that HiGR delivers consistent improvements in both offline evaluations and online deployment. Specifically, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in offline recommendation quality with a 5x inference speedup, while further achieving a 1.22% and 1.73% increase in Average Watch Time and Average Video Views in online A/B tests.","authors":["Yunsheng Pang","Zijian Liu","Yudong Li","Shaojie Zhu","Zijian Luo","Chenyun Yu","Sikai Wu","Shichen Shen","Cong Xu","Bin Wang","Kai Jiang","Hongyong Yu","Chengxiang Zhuo","Zang Li"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24762v1","updated":"2025-12-31T10:15:53Z","published":"2025-12-31T10:15:53Z","title":"OpenOneRec Technical Report","summary":"While the OneRec series has successfully unified the fragmented recommendation pipeline into an end-to-end generative framework, a significant gap remains between recommendation systems and general intelligence. Constrained by isolated data, they operate as domain specialists-proficient in pattern matching but lacking world knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and instruction following. This limitation is further compounded by the lack of a holistic benchmark to evaluate such integrated capabilities. To address this, our contributions are: 1) RecIF Bench & Open Data: We propose RecIF-Bench, a holistic benchmark covering 8 diverse tasks that thoroughly evaluate capabilities from fundamental prediction to complex reasoning. Concurrently, we release a massive training dataset comprising 96 million interactions from 160,000 users to facilitate reproducible research. 2) Framework & Scaling: To ensure full reproducibility, we open-source our comprehensive training pipeline, encompassing data processing, co-pretraining, and post-training. Leveraging this framework, we demonstrate that recommendation capabilities can scale predictably while mitigating catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge. 3) OneRec-Foundation: We release OneRec Foundation (1.7B and 8B), a family of models establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across all tasks in RecIF-Bench. Furthermore, when transferred to the Amazon benchmark, our models surpass the strongest baselines with an average 26.8% improvement in Recall@10 across 10 diverse datasets (Figure 1).

Recent works have considered steering target users beyond their historical interests by directly adjusting items exposed to them. However, the recommended items for direct steering might not align perfectly with the evolution of users' interests, detrimentally affecting the target users' experience.\n  To avoid this issue, we propose a new task named Proactive Recommendation in Social Networks (PRSN) that indirectly steers users' interest by utilizing the influence of social neighbors, i.e., indirect steering by adjusting the exposure of a target item to target users' neighbors. The key to PRSN lies in answering an interventional question: what would a target user' s feedback be on a target item if the item is exposed to the user' s different neighbors? To answer this question, we resort to causal inference and formalize PRSN as: (1) estimating the potential feedback of a user on an item, under the network interference by the item' s exposure to the user' s neighbors; and (2) adjusting the exposure of a target item to target users' neighbors to trade off steering performance and the damage to the neighbors' experience. To this end, we propose a Neighbor Interference Recommendation (NIRec) framework with two modules: (1) an interference representation-based estimation module for modeling potential feedback; (2) a post-learning-based optimization module for adjusting a target item' s exposure to trade off steering performance and the neighbors' experience through greedy search. We conduct extensive semi-simulation experiments on real-world datasets, validating the steering effectiveness of NIRec.","authors":["Hang Pan","Shuxian Bi","Wenjie Wang","Haoxuan Li","Peng Wu","Fuli Feng"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24715v1","updated":"2025-12-31T08:29:34Z","published":"2025-12-31T08:29:34Z","title":"MDiffFR: Modality-Guided Diffusion Generation for Cold-start Items in Federated Recommendation","summary":"Federated recommendations (FRs) provide personalized services while preserving user privacy by keeping user data on local clients, which has attracted significant attention in recent years. However, due to the strict privacy constraints inherent in FRs, access to user-item interaction data and user profiles across clients is highly restricted, making it difficult to learn globally effective representations for new (cold-start) items. Consequently, the item cold-start problem becomes even more challenging in FRs. Existing solutions typically predict embeddings for new items through the attribute-to-embedding mapping paradigm, which establishes a fixed one-to-one correspondence between item attributes and their embeddings. However, this one-to-one mapping paradigm often fails to model varying data distributions and tends to cause embedding misalignment, as verified by our empirical studies. To this end, we propose MDiffFR, a novel generation-based modality-guided diffusion method for cold-start items in FRs. In this framework, we employ a tailored diffusion model on the server to generate embeddings for new items, which are then distributed to clients for cold-start inference. To align item semantics, we deploy a pre-trained modality encoder to extract modality features as conditional signals to guide the reverse denoising process. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed method achieves stronger privacy guarantees compared to existing mapping-based approaches.

Regression analysis further confirms this bias, with sentence importance declining as position moves further from the start, even with with content-agnosticity.

Current benchmarks, however, evaluate VSS primarily on the recall-latency trade-off against a ground truth defined solely by distance metrics, neglecting how retrieval quality ultimately impacts downstream tasks. This disconnect can mislead both academic research and industrial practice.\n  We present Iceberg, a holistic benchmark suite for end-to-end evaluation of VSS methods in realistic application contexts. From a task-centric view, Iceberg uncovers the Information Loss Funnel, which identifies three principal sources of end-to-end performance degradation: (1) Embedding Loss during feature extraction; (2) Metric Misuse, where distances poorly reflect task relevance; (3) Data Distribution Sensitivity, highlighting index robustness across skews and modalities. For a more comprehensive assessment, Iceberg spans eight diverse datasets across key domains such as image classification, face recognition, text retrieval, and recommendation systems. Each dataset, ranging from 1M to 100M vectors, includes rich, task-specific labels and evaluation metrics, enabling assessment of retrieval algorithms within the full application pipeline rather than in isolation. Iceberg benchmarks 13 state-of-the-art VSS methods and re-ranks them based on application-level metrics, revealing substantial deviations from traditional rankings derived purely from recall-latency evaluations. Building on these insights, we define a set of task-centric meta-features and derive an interpretable decision tree to guide practitioners in selecting and tuning VSS methods for their specific workloads.","authors":["Tingyang Chen","Cong Fu","Jiahua Wu","Haotian Wu","Hua Fan","Xiangyu Ke","Yunjun Gao","Yabo Ni","Anxiang Zeng"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"SIGMOD2026"}],"Machine Learning":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25072v1","updated":"2025-12-31T18:59:53Z","published":"2025-12-31T18:59:53Z","title":"Coordinated Humanoid Manipulation with Choice Policies","summary":"Humanoid robots hold great promise for operating in human-centric environments, yet achieving robust whole-body coordination across the head, hands, and legs remains a major challenge.

We identify a dramatically different form of storage of atomic facts that we term as geometric memory. Here, the model has synthesized embeddings encoding novel global relationships between all entities, including ones that do not co-occur in training. Such storage is powerful: for instance, we show how it transforms a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition into an easy-to-learn $1$-step navigation task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry, as against a lookup of local associations, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical supervisory, architectural, or optimizational pressures. Counterintuitively, a geometry is learned even when it is more complex than the brute-force lookup.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also points out to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery, and unlearning.","authors":["Shahriar Noroozizadeh","Vaishnavh Nagarajan","Elan Rosenfeld","Sanjiv Kumar"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25063v1","updated":"2025-12-31T18:56:02Z","published":"2025-12-31T18:56:02Z","title":"Many Minds from One Model: Bayesian Transformers for Population Intelligence","summary":"Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data.

Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens.

To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal.

These models rely on larger and larger artificial neural networks (ANNs) to boost their encoding capacity, requiring GPUs to perform large-scale matrix multiplications. In contrast, the brain's spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit factorially explosive encoding capacity and compute through the polychronization of spikes rather than explicit matrix-vector products, resulting in lower energy requirements. This manifesto proposes a paradigm for framing popular AI models in terms of spiking networks and polychronization, and for interpreting spiking activity as nature's way of implementing look-up tables. This suggests a path toward converting AI models into a novel class of architectures with much smaller size yet combinatorially large encoding capacity, offering the promise of a thousandfold improvement in performance.

We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.","authors":["Haozhe Jiang","Nika Haghtalab","Lijie Chen"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24999v1","updated":"2025-12-31T17:49:37Z","published":"2025-12-31T17:49:37Z","title":"Basic Inequalities for First-Order Optimization with Applications to Statistical Risk Analysis","summary":"We introduce \\textit{basic inequalities} for first-order iterative optimization algorithms, forming a simple and versatile framework that connects implicit and explicit regularization.

This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets.

Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation.

To address this gap, we construct a merged biomedical graph that integrates (i) PrimeKG++, an augmentation of PrimeKG containing semantically rich embeddings for nodes with (ii) LINCS L1000 drug and cell line nodes, initialized with multimodal embeddings from foundation models such as MolFormerXL and BioBERT. Using this heterogeneous graph, we train a graph attention network (GAT) with a downstream prediction head that learns the delta expression profile of over 978 landmark genes for a given drug-cell pair. Our results show that our framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes (DEG) -- which predict the delta expression given a concatenated embedding of drug features, target features, and baseline cell expression -- under the scaffold and random splits.

Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time.

CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.","authors":["Xinran Gong","Gorkem Durak","Halil Ertugrul Aktas","Vedat Cicek","Jinkui Hao","Ulas Bagci","Nilay S.

We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling.","authors":["Yuchen Jiao","Na Li","Changxiao Cai","Gen Li"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04000v3","updated":"2025-12-31T15:34:39Z","published":"2025-10-05T02:18:56Z","title":"Distributed Information Bottleneck Theory for Multi-Modal Task-Aware Semantic Communication","summary":"Semantic communication shifts the focus from bit-level accuracy to task-relevant semantic delivery, enabling efficient and intelligent communication for next-generation networks. However, existing multi-modal solutions often process all available data modalities indiscriminately, ignoring that their contributions to downstream tasks are often unequal. This not only leads to severe resource inefficiency but also degrades task inference performance due to irrelevant or redundant information. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel task-aware distributed information bottleneck (TADIB) framework, which quantifies the contribution of any set of modalities to given tasks. Based on this theoretical framework, we design a practical coding scheme that intelligently selects and compresses only the most task-relevant modalities at the transmitter. To find the optimal selection and the codecs in the network, we adopt the probabilistic relaxation of discrete selection, enabling distributed encoders to make coordinated decisions with score function estimation and common randomness. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our solution matches or surpasses the inference quality of full-modal baselines while significantly reducing communication and computational costs.","authors":["Yujie Zhou","Cheng Peng","Rulong Wang","Yong Xiao","Yingyu Li","Guangming Shi","Ping Zhang"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24917v1","updated":"2025-12-31T15:21:15Z","published":"2025-12-31T15:21:15Z","title":"Frequent subgraph-based persistent homology for graph classification","summary":"Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.","authors":["Xinyang Chen","Amaël Broustet","Guoting Chen"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"Preprint. 18 pages, 10 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00571v2","updated":"2025-12-31T15:18:33Z","published":"2025-05-01T14:55:22Z","title":"Discovery and inference beyond linearity by integrating Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley values","summary":"Machine Learning (ML) is gaining popularity for hypothesis-free discovery of risk and protective factors in healthcare studies.

RuleSHAP provides detection of nonlinear and interaction effects with uncertainty quantification at the individual level. We derive an efficient formula for computing marginal Shapley values within this framework. We demonstrate the validity of our framework on simulated data.

At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy.

In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.","authors":["Raul D.

However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results.

This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.\n  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias.

These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\\partial L / \\partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry.

However, the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce MedQARo, the first large-scale medical QA benchmark in Romanian, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). We construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 105,880 QA pairs related to cancer patients from two medical centers. The questions regard medical case summaries of 1,242 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered correctly. MedQARo is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who spent a total of about 3,000 work hours to generate the QA pairs. Our benchmark contains both in-domain and cross-domain (cross-center and cross-cancer) test collections, enabling a precise assessment of generalization capabilities. We experiment with four open-source LLMs from distinct families of models on MedQARo. Each model is employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one based on supervised fine-tuning. We also evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs exposed only through APIs, namely GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Flash. Our results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform zero-shot models, clearly indicating that pretrained models fail to generalize on MedQARo. Our findings demonstrate the importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for reliable clinical QA in Romanian.

In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail.","authors":["Nam Phuong Tran","Andi Nika","Goran Radanovic","Long Tran-Thanh","Debmalya Mandal"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24767v1","updated":"2025-12-31T10:27:53Z","published":"2025-12-31T10:27:53Z","title":"From Trial to Deployment: A SEM Analysis of Traveler Adoptions to Fully Operational Autonomous Taxis","summary":"Autonomous taxi services represent a transformative advancement in urban mobility, offering safety, efficiency, and round-the-clock operations.

To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \\times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.","authors":["Fen-Yu Hsieh","Yun-Chang Teng","Ding-Yong Hong","Jan-Jan Wu"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24708v1","updated":"2025-12-31T08:25:15Z","published":"2025-12-31T08:25:15Z","title":"BandiK: Efficient Multi-Task Decomposition Using a Multi-Bandit Framework","summary":"The challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across multiple tasks is of critical importance and is also present in downstream tasks with foundation models. However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.\n  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK.","authors":["András Millinghoffer","András Formanek","András Antos","Péter Antal"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"8 pages, 14 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23335v2","updated":"2025-12-31T08:18:13Z","published":"2025-12-29T09:43:10Z","title":"Visual Language Hypothesis","summary":"We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient X/G is not a submanifold of X and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non homeomorphic, discriminative target for example, supervision via labels, cross-instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand and snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.","authors":["Xiu Li"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24696v1","updated":"2025-12-31T08:03:41Z","published":"2025-12-31T08:03:41Z","title":"Causal Discovery with Mixed Latent Confounding via Precision Decomposition","summary":"We study causal discovery from observational data in linear Gaussian systems affected by \\emph{mixed latent confounding}, where some unobserved factors act broadly across many variables while others influence only small subsets.

The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.\n  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees.

Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory.

Since their introduction, numerous variants have emerged; however, early formulations shared a fundamental limitation: they compressed the observed data into finite-dimensional global representations via aggregation operations such as mean pooling. This strategy induces an intrinsic mismatch with the infinite-dimensional nature of the stochastic processes that NPs intend to model. Convolutional conditional neural processes (ConvCNPs) address this limitation by constructing infinite-dimensional functional embeddings processed through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enforce translation equivariance. Yet CNNs with local spatial kernels struggle to capture long-range dependencies without resorting to large kernels, which impose significant computational costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose spectral ConvCNPs (SConvCNPs), which perform global convolution in the frequency domain.

However, most existing approaches assume homogeneous client models and largely overlook the challenge of model-centric heterogeneous FGL (MHtFGL), which frequently arises in practice when organizations employ graph neural networks (GNNs) of different scales and architectures.Such architectural diversity not only undermines smooth server-side aggregation, which presupposes a unified representation space shared across clients' updates, but also further complicates the transfer and integration of structural knowledge across clients. To address this issue, we propose the Federated Graph Knowledge Collaboration (FedGKC) framework. FedGKC introduces a lightweight Copilot Model on each client to facilitate knowledge exchange while local architectures are heterogeneous across clients, and employs two complementary mechanisms: Client-side Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation, which transfers effective knowledge between local and copilot models through bidirectional distillation with multi-view perturbation; and Server-side Knowledge-Aware Model Aggregation, which dynamically assigns aggregation weights based on knowledge provided by clients. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedGKC achieves an average accuracy gain of 3.88% over baselines in MHtFGL scenarios, while maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous settings.","authors":["Zhengyu Wu","Guang Zeng","Huilin Lai","Daohan Su","Jishuo Jia","Yinlin Zhu","Xunkai Li","Rong-Hua Li","Guoren Wang","Chenghu Zhou"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24665v1","updated":"2025-12-31T06:38:53Z","published":"2025-12-31T06:38:53Z","title":"HeteroHBA: A Generative Structure-Manipulating Backdoor Attack on Heterogeneous Graphs","summary":"Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved strong performance in many real-world applications, yet targeted backdoor poisoning on heterogeneous graphs remains less studied. We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses.","authors":["Honglin Gao","Lan Zhao","Junhao Ren","Xiang Li","Gaoxi Xiao"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16251v3","updated":"2025-12-31T06:16:51Z","published":"2025-12-18T07:05:25Z","title":"Interpretable Deep Learning for Stock Returns: A Consensus-Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model","summary":"We introduce the Consensus-Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model (CB-APM), a framework that reconciles the predictive power of deep learning with the structural transparency of traditional finance.

We document a striking \"interpretability-accuracy amplification effect\" for annual horizons, the structural constraint acts as an endogenous regularizer that significantly improves out-of-sample R2 over unconstrained benchmarks. Portfolios sorted on CB-APM forecasts exhibit a strong monotonic return gradient, delivering an annualized Sharpe ratio of 1.44 and robust performance across macroeconomic regimes. Furthermore, pricing diagnostics reveal that the learned consensus captures priced variation only partially spanned by canonical factor models, identifying structured risk heterogeneity that standard linear models systematically miss.

Driven by the need to analyze datasets whose objects have increasingly complex structure (such as node and edge-attributed graphs), several variants of GW distance have been introduced in the recent literature. With a view toward establishing a general framework for the theory of GW-like distances, this paper considers a vast generalization of the notion of a metric measure space: for an arbitrary metric space $Z$, we define a $Z$-network to be a measure space endowed with a kernel valued in $Z$. We introduce a method for comparing $Z$-networks by defining a generalization of GW distance, which we refer to as $Z$-Gromov-Wasserstein ($Z$-GW) distance. This construction subsumes many previously known metrics and offers a unified approach to understanding their shared properties. This paper demonstrates that the $Z$-GW distance defines a metric on the space of $Z$-networks which retains desirable properties of $Z$, such as separability, completeness, and geodesicity. Many of these properties were unknown for existing variants of GW distance that fall under our framework. Our focus is on foundational theory, but our results also include computable lower bounds and approximations of the distance which will be useful for practical applications.","authors":["Martin Bauer","Facundo Mémoli","Tom Needham","Mao Nishino"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"V4: Add a section for a numerical algorithm V3: Improved exposition.

Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.","authors":["Yury Kolomeytsev","Dmitry Golembiovsky"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"22 pages, 4 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07919v2","updated":"2025-12-31T05:49:33Z","published":"2025-11-11T07:14:13Z","title":"Feedback Descent: Open-Ended Text Optimization via Pairwise Comparison","summary":"We introduce \\textit{Feedback Descent}, a framework that optimizes text artifacts -- prompts, code, and molecules -- through structured textual feedback, rather than relying solely on scalar rewards.

Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches.

Due to the extensive observation space arising from the large number of drivers and orders, order dispatching, though fundamentally a centralized task, is often addressed using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, independent MARL methods fail to capture global information and exhibit poor cooperation among workers, while Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these challenges, we propose Triple-BERT, a centralized Single Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method designed specifically for large-scale order dispatching on ride-sharing platforms. Built on a variant TD3, our approach addresses the vast action space through an action decomposition strategy that breaks down the joint action probability into individual driver action probabilities. To handle the extensive observation space, we introduce a novel BERT-based network, where parameter reuse mitigates parameter growth as the number of drivers and orders increases, and the attention mechanism effectively captures the complex relationships among the large pool of driver and orders. We validate our method using a real-world ride-hailing dataset from Manhattan.

We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, sustained vowel phonations. Experiments utilized 15,132 recordings from 1,261 speakers in the Saarbruecken Voice Database, covering vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ at neutral, high, low, and gliding pitches. Mirroring clinical triage workflows, the framework operates in three sequential stages: Stage 1 performs binary screening of pathological versus non-pathological voices by integrating convolutional neural network-derived mel-spectrogram features with 21 interpretable acoustic biomarkers; Stage 2 stratifies voices into Healthy, Functional or Psychogenic, and Structural or Inflammatory groups using a cubic support vector machine; Stage 3 achieves fine-grained classification by incorporating probabilistic outputs from prior stages, improving discrimination of structural and inflammatory disorders relative to functional conditions. The proposed system consistently outperformed flat multi-class classifiers and pre-trained self-supervised models, including META HuBERT and Google HeAR, whose generic objectives are not optimized for sustained clinical phonation. By combining deep spectral representations with interpretable acoustic features, the framework enhances transparency and clinical alignment.

However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

The first, MULTIRISK-BASE, provides a direct finite-sample procedure for selecting thresholds, while the second, MULTIRISK, leverages data exchangeability to guarantee simultaneous control of the risks. Under mild assumptions, we show that MULTIRISK achieves nearly tight control of all constraint risks. The analysis requires an intricate iterative argument, upper bounding the risks by introducing several forms of intermediate symmetrized risk functions, and carefully lower bounding the risks by recursively counting jumps in symmetrized risk functions between appropriate risk levels.

One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement.

While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.","authors":["Zhenyu Zhang","Xiaoxia Wu","Zhongzhu Zhou","Qingyang Wu","Yineng Zhang","Pragaash Ponnusamy","Harikaran Subbaraj","Jue Wang","Shuaiwen Leon Song","Ben Athiwaratkun"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24564v1","updated":"2025-12-31T02:08:34Z","published":"2025-12-31T02:08:34Z","title":"CPR: Causal Physiological Representation Learning for Robust ECG Analysis under Distribution Shifts","summary":"Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.","authors":["Shunbo Jia","Caizhi Liao"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06205v2","updated":"2025-12-31T02:06:22Z","published":"2025-12-05T22:58:47Z","title":"On measuring grounding and generalizing grounding problems","summary":"The symbol grounding problem asks how tokens like cat can be about cats, as opposed to mere shapes manipulated in a calculus. We recast grounding from a binary judgment into an audit across desiderata, each indexed by an evaluation tuple (context, meaning type, threat model, reference distribution): authenticity (mechanisms reside inside the agent and, for strong claims, were acquired through learning or evolution); preservation (atomic meanings remain intact); faithfulness, both correlational (realized meanings match intended ones) and etiological (internal mechanisms causally contribute to success); robustness (graceful degradation under declared perturbations); compositionality (the whole is built systematically from the parts). We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition. By operationalizing a philosophical inquiry about representation, we equip philosophers of science, computer scientists, linguists, and mathematicians with a common language and technical framework for systematic investigation of grounding and meaning.","authors":["Daniel Quigley","Eric Maynard"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"resubmission: 39 pages, 85 sources, 3 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24558v1","updated":"2025-12-31T01:42:04Z","published":"2025-12-31T01:42:04Z","title":"Probabilistic Computers for Neural Quantum States","summary":"Neural quantum states efficiently represent many-body wavefunctions with neural networks, but the cost of Monte Carlo sampling limits their scaling to large system sizes.

It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels. The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region. Extensive experiments show that HUMOR empowers various VLMs with superior reasoning diversity, more reliable preference alignment, and higher overall meme quality. Beyond memes, our work presents a general training paradigm for open-ended, human-aligned multimodal generation, where success is guided by comparative judgment within coherent output group.","authors":["Xueyan Li","Yingyi Xue","Mengjie Jiang","Qingzi Zhu","Yazhe Niu"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"46 pages, 20 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24545v1","updated":"2025-12-31T01:04:34Z","published":"2025-12-31T01:04:34Z","title":"More Than Bits: Multi-Envelope Double Binary Factorization for Extreme Quantization","summary":"For extreme low-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs), Double Binary Factorization (DBF) is attractive as it enables efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.

We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.","authors":["Yuma Ichikawa","Yoshihiko Fujisawa","Yudai Fujimoto","Akira Sakai","Katsuki Fujisawa"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"14 pages, 2 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24542v1","updated":"2025-12-31T01:00:22Z","published":"2025-12-31T01:00:22Z","title":"A Graph Neural Network with Auxiliary Task Learning for Missing PMU Data Reconstruction","summary":"In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.","authors":["Bo Li","Zijun Chen","Haiwang Zhong","Di Cao","Guangchun Ruan"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13050v3","updated":"2025-12-31T00:31:11Z","published":"2023-11-21T23:22:11Z","title":"Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization: A Review","summary":"Resided at the intersection of multi-fidelity optimization (MFO) and Bayesian optimization (BO), MF BO has found a niche in solving expensive engineering design optimization problems, thanks to its advantages in incorporating physical and mathematical understandings of the problems, saving resources, addressing exploitation-exploration trade-off, considering uncertainty, and processing parallel computing.

We then exploit the common properties shared between the methods from each ingredient of MF BO to describe important GP-based MF surrogate models and review various acquisition functions.

In recent years, Automatic Stage Lighting Control (ASLC) has attracted growing interest due to the high costs of hiring or training professional lighting engineers. However, most existing ASLC solutions only classify music into limited categories and map them to predefined light patterns, resulting in formulaic and monotonous outcomes that lack rationality. To address this gap, this paper presents Skip-BART, an end-to-end model that directly learns from experienced lighting engineers and predict vivid, human-like stage lighting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to conceptualize ASLC as a generative task rather than merely a classification problem. Our method adapts the BART model to take audio music as input and produce light hue and value (intensity) as output, incorporating a novel skip connection mechanism to enhance the relationship between music and light within the frame grid. To address the lack of available datasets, we create the first stage lighting dataset, along with several pre-training and transfer learning techniques to improve model training with limited data. We validate our method through both quantitative analysis and an human evaluation, demonstrating that Skip-BART outperforms conventional rule-based methods across all evaluation metrics and shows only a limited gap compared to real lighting engineers.

A two-level clustering procedure is applied to these embeddings, and the resulting clusters are mapped to the diseases of interest to derive weak labels for a subset of data, eventually used to train a transformer-based classifier. We evaluate the approach on a real-world case study on bronchiolitis in a corpus of 33,176 Italian discharge letters of children admitted to 44 emergency rooms or hospitals in the Veneto Region between 2017 and 2020. The pipeline achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 77.68% ($\\pm 4.30\\%)$ and an F1-score of 78.14% ($\\pm 4.89\\%$) against manual annotations.

Through iterative, Design-Based Research (DBR) cycles, the study progressed from rule-based to transformer-based with a regression head scoring, mounted with adaptive feedback.\n  Early cycles (2-3) revealed fundamental limitations of rule-based approaches: mid-band compression, low accuracy, and negative $R^2$ values.

We evaluated 25 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets.

Even clinically fine-tuned models showed gains from RaR (e.g., MedGemma-27B), indicating that retrieval remains beneficial despite embedded domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of RaR to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility.

Previous research shows that using test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive, preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline, achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models (GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.","authors":["Zeming Chen","Angelika Romanou","Gail Weiss","Antoine Bosselut"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"10 pages, 7 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17974v3","updated":"2025-12-30T19:22:48Z","published":"2025-07-23T22:45:30Z","title":"Natural Language Processing for Tigrinya: Current State and Future Directions","summary":"Despite being spoken by millions of people, Tigrinya remains severely underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research.

Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs' privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs' internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods.

Analyzing data across all documented human languages, we identify four categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality and digitality), Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices (36%, low on both dimensions), and critically, Invisible Giants (27%, high vitality but near-zero digitality) - languages spoken by millions yet absent from the LLM universe. We demonstrate that these patterns reflect continuities from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development, constituting digital epistemic injustice. Our analysis reveals that English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge. We conclude with implications for decolonizing language technology and democratizing access to AI benefits.","authors":["Saurabh Khanna","Xinxu Li"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24410v1","updated":"2025-12-30T18:45:00Z","published":"2025-12-30T18:45:00Z","title":"Comparing Approaches to Automatic Summarization in Less-Resourced Languages","summary":"Automatic text summarization has achieved high performance in high-resourced languages like English, but comparatively less attention has been given to summarization in less-resourced languages.

Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.","authors":["Waheed Ahmed Abro","Zied Bouraoui"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24340v1","updated":"2025-12-30T16:48:20Z","published":"2025-12-30T16:48:20Z","title":"DermaVQA-DAS: Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS) & Datasets for Closed-Ended Question Answering & Segmentation in Patient-Generated Dermatology Images","summary":"Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783).

Although recent advances in deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially improved performance, most existing approaches still rely on black-box predictions of a single model, making it difficult to structurally explain the cognitive factors underlying sarcasm. Moreover, while sarcasm often emerges as a mismatch between semantic evaluation and normative expectations or intentions, frameworks that explicitly decompose and model these components remain limited. In this work, we reformulate sarcasm understanding as a world model inspired reasoning process and propose World Model inspired SArcasm Reasoning (WM-SAR), which decomposes literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention into specialized LLM-based agents. The discrepancy between literal evaluation and normative expectation is explicitly quantified as a deterministic inconsistency score, and together with an intention score, these signals are integrated by a lightweight Logistic Regression model to infer the final sarcasm probability. This design leverages the reasoning capability of LLMs while maintaining an interpretable numerical decision structure. Experiments on representative sarcasm detection benchmarks show that WM-SAR consistently outperforms existing deep learning and LLM-based methods. Ablation studies and case analyses further demonstrate that integrating semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning is essential for effective sarcasm detection, achieving both strong performance and high interpretability.","authors":["Keito Inoshita","Shinnosuke Mizuno"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24314v1","updated":"2025-12-30T16:10:51Z","published":"2025-12-30T16:10:51Z","title":"QianfanHuijin Technical Report: A Novel Multi-Stage Training Paradigm for Finance Industrial LLMs","summary":"Domain-specific enhancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the financial context has long been a focal point of industrial application.

In this paper, we present QianfanHuijin, a financial domain LLM, and propose a generalizable multi-stage training paradigm for industrial model enhancement.\n  Our approach begins with Continual Pre-training (CPT) on financial corpora to consolidate the knowledge base. This is followed by a fine-grained Post-training pipeline designed with increasing specificity: starting with Financial SFT, progressing to Finance Reasoning RL and Finance Agentic RL, and culminating in General RL aligned with real-world business scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate that QianfanHuijin achieves superior performance across various authoritative financial benchmarks. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that the targeted Reasoning RL and Agentic RL stages yield significant gains in their respective capabilities.

FIGR externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving. By adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked, FIGR enables more stable and coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines.

We use this dataset to conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs on the core compliance workflow. Our results reveal a clear performance gap between qualitative and quantitative tasks. LLMs show moderate success in the qualitative task of identifying economic activities, with a multi-step agentic framework modestly enhancing precision. Conversely, the models comprehensively fail at the quantitative task of predicting financial KPIs in a zero-shot setting. We also discover a paradox, where concise metadata often yields superior performance to full, unstructured reports, and find that model confidence scores are poorly calibrated.

One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.","authors":["Ziqing Fan","Yuqiao Xian","Yan Sun","Li Shen"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24259v1","updated":"2025-12-30T14:36:17Z","published":"2025-12-30T14:36:17Z","title":"Tracing the Flow of Knowledge From Science to Technology Using Deep Learning","summary":"We develop a language similarity model suitable for working with patents and scientific publications at the same time.

Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence (SI). We thus propose EASI for holistic Evaluation of multimodAl LLMs on Spatial Intelligence. EASI conceptualizes a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a growing collection of newly curated ones, enabling systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models. In this report, we conduct the study across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in SI, yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail the most advanced multimodal models. EASI is an ongoing community effort: we have open-sourced the EASI codebase that provides a one-stop and reproducible solution with standardized interfaces, integrated protocols and prompts that significantly reduce the friction of configuring and running multiple benchmarks; we have also launched an accompanying EASI leaderboard to provide a continually updated snapshot of model performance across the full SI spectrum, accelerating collective progress toward robust SI.","authors":["Zhongang Cai","Yubo Wang","Qingping Sun","Ruisi Wang","Chenyang Gu","Wanqi Yin","Zhiqian Lin","Zhitao Yang","Chen Wei","Oscar Qian","Hui En Pang","Xuanke Shi","Kewang Deng","Xiaoyang Han","Zukai Chen","Jiaqi Li","Xiangyu Fan","Hanming Deng","Lewei Lu","Bo Li","Ziwei Liu","Quan Wang","Dahua Lin","Lei Yang"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"Codebase: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/EASI/ ; Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmms-lab-si/EASI-Leaderboard"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23512v2","updated":"2025-12-30T13:23:48Z","published":"2025-12-29T14:49:50Z","title":"UniHetero: Could Generation Enhance Understanding for Vision-Language-Model at Large Data Scale?","summary":"Vision-language large models are moving toward the unification of visual understanding and visual generation tasks. However, whether generation can enhance understanding is still under-explored on large data scale. In this work, we analysis the unified structure with a concise model, UniHetero, under large-scale pretraining (>200M samples). Our key observations are: (1) Generation can improve understanding, but Only if you generate Semantics, Not Pixels. A common assumption in unified vision-language models is that adding generation will naturally strengthen understanding. However, this is not always true at scale. At 200M+ pretraining samples, generation helps understanding only when it operates at the semantic level, i.e. when the model learns to autoregress high-level visual representations inside the LLM. Once pixel-level objectives (e.g., diffusion losses) directly interfere with the LLM, understanding performance often degrades. (2) Generation reveals a superior Data Scaling trend and higher Data Utilization. Unified generation-understanding demonstrates a superior scaling trend compared to understanding alone, revealing a more effective way to learn vision-only knowledge directive from vision modality rather than captioning to text. (3) Autoregression on Input Embedding is effective to capture visual details. Compared to the commonly-used vision encoder, make visual autoregression on input embedding shows less cumulative error and is modality independent, which can be extend to all modalities. The learned semantic representations capture visual information such as objects, locations, shapes, and colors; further enable pixel-level image generation.","authors":["Fengjiao Chen","Minhao Jing","Weitao Lu","Yan Feng","Xiaoyu Li","Xuezhi Cao"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10481v2","updated":"2025-12-30T13:22:28Z","published":"2025-04-14T17:59:36Z","title":"xVerify: Efficient Answer Verifier for Reasoning Model Evaluations","summary":"With the release of OpenAI's o1 model, reasoning models that adopt slow-thinking strategies have become increasingly common.

In particular, they struggle to judge answer equivalence and to reliably extract final answers from long, complex responses. To address this challenge, we propose xVerify, an efficient answer verifier for evaluating reasoning models. xVerify shows strong equivalence judgment capabilities, enabling accurate comparison between model outputs and reference answers across diverse question types. To train and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset, which consists of question-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets. The dataset incorporates multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets specifically designed for reasoning assessment, with a multi-round annotation process to ensure label quality. Based on VAR, we train xVerify models at different scales. Experimental results on both test and generalization sets show that all xVerify variants achieve over 95% F1 score and accuracy. Notably, the smallest model, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o, while xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance. In addition, reinforcement learning experiments using xVerify as the reward model yield an 18.4% improvement for Qwen2.5-7B compared with direct generation, exceeding the gains achieved with Math Verify as the reward.

Existing studies are limited by their reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response data and their focus on coarse-grained, general-purpose metrics (e.g., coherence and helpfulness), overlooking the nuanced, scenario-specific requirements of real-world tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a framework utilizing Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced reward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first decomposes each instruction into a set of fine-grained, adaptive constraint criteria spanning key dimensions of long-form generation tasks. Subsequently, we design a reward mechanism to quantify the response quality based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints, converting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally, we leverage reinforcement learning to optimize LLMs using these fine-grained signals. Experimental results show that ACE-RL significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 18.63% and 7.61% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary systems like GPT-4o by 8.76%, providing a more effective training paradigm in long-form generation scenarios.","authors":["Jianghao Chen","Wei Sun","Qixiang Yin","Zhixing Tan","Jiajun Zhang"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"Under review"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01424v2","updated":"2025-12-30T10:58:54Z","published":"2023-04-04T00:13:55Z","title":"CascadeNS: Confidence-Cascaded Neurosymbolic Model for Sarcasm Detection","summary":"Sarcasm detection in product reviews requires balancing domain-specific symbolic pattern recognition with deep semantic understanding.

In this paper, we propose a novel method called Dual LoRA to improve the performance by incorporating an inductive bias into the original LoRA. Specifically, we separate low-rank matrices into two groups: the magnitude group to control whether or not and how far we should update a parameter and the direction group to decide whether this parameter should move forward or backward, to better simulate the parameter updating process of the full fine-tuning based on gradient-based optimization algorithms. We show that this can be simply achieved by adding a ReLU function to the magnitude group and a sign function to the direction group. We conduct several experiments over a wide range of NLP tasks, including natural language understanding (NLU) and commonsense reasoning datasets on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and LLaMA-1/2/3 as baseline models.

Current methods, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation, partially address these issues by grounding answers in source documents, but hallucinations and low fact-level explainability persist. In this work, we introduce a novel atomic fact-checking framework designed to enhance the reliability and explainability of LLMs used in medical long-form question answering. This method decomposes LLM-generated responses into discrete, verifiable units called atomic facts, each of which is independently verified against an authoritative knowledge base of medical guidelines. This approach enables targeted correction of errors and direct tracing to source literature, thereby improving the factual accuracy and explainability of medical Q&A. Extensive evaluation using multi-reader assessments by medical experts and an automated open Q&A benchmark demonstrated significant improvements in factual accuracy and explainability. Our framework achieved up to a 40% overall answer improvement and a 50% hallucination detection rate. The ability to trace each atomic fact back to the most relevant chunks from the database provides a granular, transparent explanation of the generated responses, addressing a major gap in current medical AI applications.

We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a \"grounding then answering with evidence referencing\" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding.

To address this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of jailbreak attacks targeting LLM safety alignment, assessing their success across the full inference pipeline, including both input and output filtering stages. Our findings yield two key insights: first, nearly all evaluated jailbreak techniques can be detected by at least one safety filter, suggesting that prior assessments may have overestimated the practical success of these attacks; second, while safety filters are effective in detection, there remains room to better balance recall and precision to further optimize protection and user experience.

We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.","authors":["Sijia Chen","Di Niu"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"9 pages, 6 figures.

Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.","authors":["Zhenyu Zhang","Shujian Zhang","John Lambert","Wenxuan Zhou","Zhangyang Wang","Mingqing Chen","Andrew Hard","Rajiv Mathews","Lun Wang"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01560v3","updated":"2025-12-30T04:36:06Z","published":"2025-09-01T15:42:21Z","title":"In-N-Out: A Parameter-Level API Graph Dataset for Tool Agents","summary":"Tool agents--LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs--offer a way to execute real-world tasks.

To support this, we introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone.

Recently, researchers have attempted to incorporate this knowledge into large language model-based recommender approaches (LLMRec) to enhance their performance. However, there has been little fundamental analysis of whether LLMs can effectively reason over collaborative information. In this paper, we analyze the ability of LLMs to reason about collaborative information in recommendation tasks, comparing their performance to traditional matrix factorization (MF) models. We propose a simple and effective method to improve LLMs' reasoning capabilities using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over the user-item interaction matrix with four different prompting strategies. Our results show that the LLM outperforms the MF model whenever we provide relevant information in a clear and easy-to-follow format, and prompt the LLM to reason based on it.

However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy.

However, recent perspectives suggest that some hallucinations may encode creative or epistemically valuable content, a dimension that remains underquantified in current literature. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily focus on factual consistency, struggling to handle heterogeneous scientific tasks and balance creativity with accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose HIC-Bench, a novel evaluation framework that categorizes hallucinations into Intelligent Hallucinations (IH) and Defective Hallucinations (DH), enabling systematic investigation of their interplay in LLM creativity. HIC-Bench features three core characteristics: (1) Structured IH/DH Assessment. using a multi-dimensional metric matrix integrating Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) metrics (Originality, Feasibility, Value) with hallucination-specific dimensions (scientific plausibility, factual deviation); (2) Cross-Domain Applicability. spanning ten scientific domains with open-ended innovation tasks; and (3) Dynamic Prompt Optimization. leveraging the Dynamic Hallucination Prompt (DHP) to guide models toward creative and reliable outputs. The evaluation process employs multiple LLM judges, averaging scores to mitigate bias, with human annotators verifying IH/DH classifications. Experimental results reveal a nonlinear relationship between IH and DH, demonstrating that creativity and correctness can be jointly optimized. These insights position IH as a catalyst for creativity and reveal the ability of LLM hallucinations to drive scientific innovation.Additionally, the HIC-Bench offers a valuable platform for advancing research into the creative intelligence of LLM hallucinations.","authors":["Chengxu Yang","Jingling Yuan","Siqi Cai","Jiawei Jiang","Chuang Hu"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"Published as a conference paper at KDD 2026"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23971v1","updated":"2025-12-30T03:58:38Z","published":"2025-12-30T03:58:38Z","title":"CEC-Zero: Zero-Supervision Character Error Correction with Self-Generated Rewards","summary":"Large-scale Chinese spelling correction (CSC) remains critical for real-world text processing, yet existing LLMs and supervised methods lack robustness to novel errors and rely on costly annotations.

Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.","authors":["Chulun Zhou","Chunkang Zhang","Guoxin Yu","Fandong Meng","Jie Zhou","Wai Lam","Mo Yu"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"21 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23328v2","updated":"2025-12-30T02:44:39Z","published":"2025-12-29T09:25:56Z","title":"CubeBench: Diagnosing Interactive, Long-Horizon Spatial Reasoning Under Partial Observations","summary":"Large Language Model (LLM) agents, while proficient in the digital realm, face a significant gap in physical-world deployment due to the challenge of forming and maintaining a robust spatial mental model.

Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and derive text representations from sentence embeddings, incorporating centering and residualization to mitigate prompt and teacher confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and a projection surfaces model disagreements for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the residual content representation, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond.

ADS employs an off-the-shelf pretrained denoiser as a differentiable proxy for diffusion-based decoders and incorporates a color-aware, quaternion-coupled update rule to reduce artifacts under strict distortion limits. Under a practical threat model and in evaluation against the state-of-the-art diffusion steganography method Pulsar, ADS drives decoder success rates to near zero with minimal perceptual impact.

In this work, we evaluate a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model, USF-MAE, for first-trimester fetal heart view classification. USF-MAE is pretrained using masked autoencoding modelling on more than 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images spanning over 40 anatomical regions and is subsequently fine-tuned for downstream classification. As a proof of concept, the pretrained Vision Transformer encoder was fine-tuned on an open-source dataset of 6,720 first-trimester fetal echocardiography images to classify five categories: aorta, atrioventricular flows, V sign, X sign, and Other. Model performance was benchmarked against supervised convolutional neural network baselines (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) model pretrained on natural images (ImageNet-1k).

In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI.

Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform.

However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.","authors":["Devendra K. Jangid","Ripon K.

Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) are key enablers, with XL-MIMO boosting spectral and energy efficiency through numerous antennas, and RIS offering dynamic control over the wireless environment via passive reflective elements. However, realizing their full potential depends on accurate Channel State Information (CSI). Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated efficient cascaded channel estimation. However, the scalability and practical deployment of existing estimation models in XL-MIMO systems remain limited. The growing number of antennas and RIS elements introduces a significant barrier to real-time and efficient channel estimation, drastically increasing data volume, escalating computational complexity, requiring advanced hardware, and resulting in substantial energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for efficient cascaded channel estimation in XL-MIMO systems, designed to minimize computational complexity and make it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Using spatial correlations in the channel, we introduce a patch-based training mechanism that reduces the dimensionality of input to patch-level representations while preserving essential information, allowing scalable training for large-scale systems. Simulation results under diverse conditions demonstrate that our framework significantly improves estimation accuracy and reduces computational complexity, regardless of the increasing number of antennas and RIS elements in XL-MIMO systems.","authors":["Muhammad Kamran Saeed","Ashfaq Khokhar","Shakil Ahmed"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18717v2","updated":"2025-12-30T20:56:01Z","published":"2025-08-26T06:27:50Z","title":"Natural Image Classification via Quasi-Cyclic Graph Ensembles and Random-Bond Ising Models at the Nishimori Temperature","summary":"Modern multi-class image classification relies on high-dimensional CNN feature vectors, which are computationally expensive and obscure the underlying data geometry.

Our method rests on two innovations: we prove a spectral-topological correspondence linking graph trapping sets to invariants via the Ihara-Bass zeta function removing these structures boosts top-1 accuracy over four-fold in multi-class settings; we develop a quadratic-Newton estimator for the Nishimori temperature converging in around 9 Arnoldi iterations for a 6-times speedup enabling spectral embedding on scales like ImageNet-100.

Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.","authors":["Yan Meng","Daniel A.

In complex urban areas, LST exhibits significant variations, fluctuating dramatically within and across city blocks. Landsat provides high spatial resolution data at 100 meters but is limited by long revisit time, with cloud cover further disrupting data collection. Here, we propose DELAG, a deep ensemble learning method that integrates annual temperature cycles and Gaussian processes, to reconstruct Landsat LST in complex urban areas. Leveraging the cross-track characteristics and dual-satellite operation of Landsat since 2021, we further enhance data availability to 4 scenes every 16 days. We select New York City, London and Hong Kong from three different continents as study areas. Experiments show that DELAG successfully reconstructed LST in the three cities under clear-sky (RMSE = 0.73-0.96 K) and heavily-cloudy (RMSE = 0.84-1.62 K) situations, superior to existing methods. Additionally, DELAG can quantify uncertainty that enhances LST reconstruction reliability. We further tested the reconstructed LST to estimate near-surface air temperature, achieving results (RMSE = 1.48-2.11 K) comparable to those derived from clear-sky LST (RMSE = 1.63-2.02 K). The results demonstrate the successful reconstruction through DELAG and highlight the broader applications of LST reconstruction for estimating accurate air temperature. Our study thus provides a novel and practical method for Landsat LST reconstruction, particularly suited for complex urban areas within Landsat cross-track areas, taking one step toward addressing complex climate events at high spatiotemporal resolution.

To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.\n  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.","authors":["Gur-Eyal Sela","Kumar Krishna Agrawal","Bharathan Balaji","Joseph Gonzalez","Ion Stoica"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"21 pages, 23 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24385v1","updated":"2025-12-30T17:58:01Z","published":"2025-12-30T17:58:01Z","title":"Forging Spatial Intelligence: A Roadmap of Multi-Modal Data Pre-Training for Autonomous Systems","summary":"The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and drones, has intensified the need to forge true Spatial Intelligence from multi-modal onboard sensor data.

An under-explored question of PEFT is in extending the pre-training phase without supervised labels; that is, can we adapt a pre-trained foundation model to a new domain via efficient self-supervised pre-training on this domain? In this work, we introduce ExPLoRA, a highly effective technique to improve transfer learning of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) under domain shifts. Initializing a ViT with pre-trained weights on large, natural-image datasets such as from DinoV2 or MAE, ExPLoRA continues the unsupervised pre-training objective on a new domain, unfreezing 1-2 pre-trained ViT blocks and tuning all other layers with LoRA. We then fine-tune the resulting model only with LoRA on this new domain for supervised learning. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on satellite imagery, even outperforming fully pre-training and fine-tuning ViTs. Using the DinoV2 training objective, we demonstrate up to 8% improvement in linear probing top-1 accuracy on downstream tasks while using <10% of the number of parameters that are used in prior fully-tuned state-of-the-art approaches.

Unlike purely neural approaches that rely on transient attention maps, IUT-Plug introduces the Image Understanding Tree (IUT) as an explicit, persistent memory module. The framework operates by (1) parsing visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures (entities, attributes, and relationships); (2) performing incremental state updates to logically lock invariant properties while modifying changing elements; and (3) guiding generation through topological constraints. We evaluate our approach on a novel benchmark comprising 3,000 human-annotated samples.

To address these limitations, we introduce Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPL), a framework that aims to improve prompt-task alignment through two complementary components: a Sparse Prompt Module (SPM) that efficiently captures degradation-aware representations while reducing redundancy, and a Contrastive Prompt Regularization (CPR) that explicitly strengthens task boundaries by incorporating negative prompt samples across different degradation types. Unlike previous approaches that focus primarily on degradation classification, CPL directly optimizes the interaction between prompts and the restoration model. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks show that CPL consistently boosts the performance of strong AiOIR baselines across diverse scenarios.

While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.","authors":["Yuan Jia","Ruimin Wu","Rui Song","Jiaojiao Li","Bin Song"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"16 pages, 10 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24271v1","updated":"2025-12-30T14:53:33Z","published":"2025-12-30T14:53:33Z","title":"Taming Hallucinations: Boosting MLLMs' Video Understanding via Counterfactual Video Generation","summary":"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding.

This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline.

To bridge this gap, we present CVBench, the first diagnostic benchmark designed to assess cross-video relational reasoning rigorously.

In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality.

While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block.

This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.","authors":["Sina Jahromi","Farshid Hajati","Alireza Rezaee","Javaher Nourian"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24212v1","updated":"2025-12-30T13:25:22Z","published":"2025-12-30T13:25:22Z","title":"RANGER: A Monocular Zero-Shot Semantic Navigation Framework through Contextual Adaptation","summary":"Efficiently finding targets in complex environments is fundamental to real-world embodied applications. While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have enabled zero-shot object goal navigation, allowing robots to search for arbitrary objects without fine-tuning, existing methods face two key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on precise depth and pose information provided by simulators, which restricts applicability in real-world scenarios; and (2) lack of in-context learning (ICL) capability, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new environments, as in leveraging short videos. To address these challenges, we propose RANGER, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that operates using only a monocular camera. Leveraging powerful 3D foundation models, RANGER eliminates the dependency on depth and pose while exhibiting strong ICL capability. By simply observing a short video of a new environment, the system can also significantly improve task efficiency without requiring architectural modifications or fine-tuning. The framework integrates several key components: keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, vision-language model (VLM)-driven exploration value estimation, high-level adaptive waypoint selection, and low-level action execution. Experiments on the HM3D benchmark and real-world environments demonstrate that RANGER achieves competitive performance in terms of navigation success rate and exploration efficiency, while showing superior ICL adaptability, with no previous 3D mapping of the environment required.","authors":["Ming-Ming Yu","Yi Chen","Börje F.

In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application.

CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality.

However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference.

Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters. Beyond potato weight estimation, PointRAFT provides a versatile regression network applicable to a wide range of 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks.

Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries. Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.

However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines.

To address this, we propose GoMatching++, a parameter- and data-efficient method that transforms an off-the-shelf image text spotter into a video specialist. The core idea lies in freezing the image text spotter and introducing a lightweight, trainable tracker, which can be optimized efficiently with minimal training data.

Visual occlusion from obstacles, such as foliage, can severely obstruct a robot's sensors, impairing scene understanding. We show that \"peering\", a characteristic side-to-side movement used by insects to overcome their visual limitations, can also allow robots to markedly improve visual reasoning under partial occlusion. This is accomplished by applying core signal processing principles, specifically optical synthetic aperture sensing, together with the vision reasoning capabilities of modern large multimodal models.

The approach is low-cost and immediately deployable on any camera-equipped robot. We investigated different peering motions and occlusion masking strategies, demonstrating that, unlike peering, state-of-the-art multi-view 3D vision techniques fail in these conditions due to their high susceptibility to occlusion. Our experiments were carried out on an industrial-grade quadrupedal robot. However, the ability to peer is not limited to such platforms, but potentially also applicable to bipedal, hexapod, wheeled, or crawling platforms.

In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.","authors":["Chubin Chen","Sujie Hu","Jiashu Zhu","Meiqi Wu","Jintao Chen","Yanxun Li","Nisha Huang","Chengyu Fang","Jiahong Wu","Xiangxiang Chu","Xiu Li"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24138v1","updated":"2025-12-30T10:55:45Z","published":"2025-12-30T10:55:45Z","title":"GARDO: Reinforcing Diffusion Models without Reward Hacking","summary":"Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target.

By applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA creates valid augmented samples from the data distribution with high diversity, properties we theoretically show that are essential for a Test-Time Augmentation method to be effective. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus reducing significantly the test time computational cost. Our comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, pneumonia detection, speech recognition and house price prediction, validate the generality of the proposed GTTA.

We introduce $\\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish $\\infty$-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that $\\infty$-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores.","authors":["Hidir Yesiltepe","Tuna Han Salih Meral","Adil Kaan Akan","Kaan Oktay","Pinar Yanardag"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"Project Page: https://infinity-rope.github.io/"}],"Information Retrieval":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24366v1","updated":"2025-12-30T17:25:15Z","published":"2025-12-30T17:25:15Z","title":"On the Factual Consistency of Text-based Explainable Recommendation Models","summary":"Text-based explainable recommendation aims to generate natural-language explanations that justify item recommendations, to improve user trust and system transparency.

We design a prompting-based pipeline that uses LLMs to extract atomic explanatory statements from reviews, thereby constructing a ground truth that isolates and focuses on their factual content. Applying this pipeline to five categories from the Amazon Reviews dataset, we create augmented benchmarks for fine-grained evaluation of explanation quality. We further propose statement-level alignment metrics that combine LLM- and NLI-based approaches to assess both factual consistency and relevance of generated explanations. Across extensive experiments on six state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models, we uncover a critical gap: while models achieve high semantic similarity scores (BERTScore F1: 0.81-0.90), all our factuality metrics reveal alarmingly low performance (LLM-based statement-level precision: 4.38%-32.88%).

We investigate how attackers may achieve this via content injection, injecting arbitrary sentences into relevant passages or query terms into arbitrary passages.

To systematically address these challenges, we propose the Time-Aware Adaptive Side Information Fusion (TASIF) framework. TASIF integrates three synergistic components: (1) a simple, plug-and-play time span partitioning mechanism to capture global temporal patterns; (2) an adaptive frequency filter that leverages a learnable gate to denoise feature sequences adaptively, thereby providing higher-quality inputs for subsequent fusion modules; and (3) an efficient adaptive side information fusion layer, this layer employs a \"guide-not-mix\" architecture, where attributes guide the attention mechanism without being mixed into the content-representing item embeddings, ensuring deep interaction while ensuring computational efficiency.

However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent \"Black-Box\" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.","authors":["Jiaxin Hu","Tao Wang","Bingsan Yang","Hongrun Wang"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"9 pages, 6 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24078v1","updated":"2025-12-30T08:40:48Z","published":"2025-12-30T08:40:48Z","title":"High-dimensional Regret Minimization","summary":"Multi-criteria decision making in large databases is very important in real world applications.

This approach iteratively asks the user to select the one preferred within a set of options.

It is well known from statistical information theory that the Fisher information coincides with the Hessian of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Thus, the metric Kähler potential relation is exactly achieved under relative entropy. We propose a Kähler potential derivative of complex Gaussian mixtures that acts as a rough proxy to the Fisher information metric while still being faithful to the underlying Kähler geometry. Computation of the metric via this potential is efficient, and through our potential, valid as a plurisubharmonic (PSH) function, large scale computational burden of automatic differentiation is displaced to small scale. Our methods leverage the law of total covariance to bridge behavior between our potential and the Fisher metric.

Due to the (often substantial) improvement of the computational efficiency, they have been widely used in large-scale machine learning applications. It has been demonstrated that the so-called covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin (CCAdL) thermostat, which incorporates an additional term involving the covariance matrix of the noisy force, outperforms popular alternative methods. A moving average is used in CCAdL to estimate the covariance matrix of the noisy force, in which case the covariance matrix will converge to a constant matrix in long-time limit. Moreover, it appears in our numerical experiments that the use of a moving average could reduce the stability of the numerical integrators, thereby limiting the largest usable stepsize. In this article, we propose a modified CCAdL (i.e., mCCAdL) thermostat that uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential to numerically approximate the exact solution to the subsystem involving the additional term proposed in CCAdL. We also propose a symmetric splitting method for mCCAdL, instead of an Euler-type discretisation used in the original CCAdL thermostat. We demonstrate in our numerical experiments that the newly proposed mCCAdL thermostat achieves a substantial improvement in the numerical stability over the original CCAdL thermostat, while significantly outperforming popular alternative stochastic gradient methods in terms of the numerical accuracy for large-scale machine learning applications.","authors":["Jiani Wei","Xiaocheng Shang"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03743v2","updated":"2025-12-30T23:24:53Z","published":"2025-12-03T12:40:49Z","title":"Cross-embodied Co-design for Dexterous Hands","summary":"Dexterous manipulation is limited by both control and design, without consensus as to what makes manipulators best for performing dexterous tasks.

However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers.

In this work, we uncover a subtle yet critical issue in the standard experimental protocol for data recipe assessment: the use of identical small-scale model training configurations across all data recipes in the name of \"fair\" comparison. We show that the experiment conclusions about data quality can flip with even minor adjustments to training hyperparameters, as the optimal training configuration is inherently data-dependent. Moreover, this fixed-configuration protocol diverges from full-scale model development pipelines, where hyperparameter optimization is a standard step. Consequently, we posit that the objective of data recipe assessment should be to identify the recipe that yields the best performance under data-specific tuning. To mitigate the high cost of hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a simple patch to the evaluation protocol: using reduced learning rates for proxy model training. We show that this approach yields relative performance that strongly correlates with that of fully tuned large-scale LLM pretraining runs. Theoretically, we prove that for random-feature models, this approach preserves the ordering of datasets according to their optimal achievable loss. Empirically, we validate this approach across 23 data recipes covering four critical dimensions of data curation, demonstrating dramatic improvements in the reliability of small-scale experiments.","authors":["Jiachen T.

A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which leverage pretrained vision and language models, have recently demonstrated strong capability in joint vision-language understanding. However, both the presence and severity of spurious biases in MLLMs remain poorly understood. In this work, we address this gap by analyzing the spurious biases in the multimodal setting and uncovering the specific inference-time data patterns that can manifest this problem. To support this analysis, we introduce MM-SpuBench, a comprehensive, human-verified benchmark dataset consisting of image-class pairs annotated with core and spurious attributes, grounded in our taxonomy of nine distinct types of spurious correlations. The benchmark is constructed using human-interpretable attribute information to capture a wide range of spurious patterns reflective of real-world knowledge. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary MLLMs with both standard accuracy and the proposed Conditional Generation Likelihood Advantage (CGLA).

We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables.

After extracting diagnosis-related sentences, the method leverages a transformer-based model with an additional pre-training on Italian medical documents to generate semantic embeddings. A two-level clustering procedure is applied to these embeddings, and the resulting clusters are mapped to the diseases of interest to derive weak labels for a subset of data, eventually used to train a transformer-based classifier. We evaluate the approach on a real-world case study on bronchiolitis in a corpus of 33,176 Italian discharge letters of children admitted to 44 emergency rooms or hospitals in the Veneto Region between 2017 and 2020.

We propose a dynamic-optimal-transport-like minimization objective and derive its Kantorovich formulation for discrete flows with convex interpolants, where transport cost depends solely on inter-state similarity and can be optimized via minibatch strategies. In the case of bag-of-words (BoW) sourced flows, we show that such methods can reduce the number of transitions up to 8 times (1024 to 128) to reach the same generative perplexity without compromising diversity. Additionally, path nondeterminism in discrete flows precludes an instantaneous change-of-variables analogue, preventing precise probability estimation available to continuous flows. We therefore propose two upper bounds on perplexity, enabling principled training, evaluation and model comparison. Finally, we introduce Multimask Flows which outperform masked flows in generative perplexity, particularly when utilizing minibatch Optimal Transport, without sacrificing diversity.","authors":["Etrit Haxholli","Yeti Z.

Here we propose radiology Retrieval and Reasoning (RaR), a multi-step retrieval and reasoning framework designed to improve diagnostic accuracy, factual consistency, and clinical reliability of LLMs in radiology question answering. We evaluated 25 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. To assess generalizability, we additionally tested on an unseen internal dataset of 65 real-world radiology board examination questions. RaR significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting and conventional online RAG. The greatest gains occurred in small-scale models, while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, RaR retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models showed gains from RaR (e.g., MedGemma-27B), indicating that retrieval remains beneficial despite embedded domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of RaR to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility.

Previous research shows that using test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive, preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline, achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models (GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.","authors":["Zeming Chen","Angelika Romanou","Gail Weiss","Antoine Bosselut"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"10 pages, 7 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24452v1","updated":"2025-12-30T20:19:49Z","published":"2025-12-30T20:19:49Z","title":"Privacy-Preserving Semantic Communications via Multi-Task Learning and Adversarial Perturbations","summary":"Semantic communications conveys task-relevant meaning rather than focusing solely on message reconstruction, improving bandwidth efficiency and robustness for next-generation wireless systems. However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Semantic accuracy and reconstruction quality improve with increasing latent dimension, while the min-max mechanism reduces the eavesdropper's inference performance significantly without degrading the legitimate receiver. The perturbation layer is successful in reducing semantic leakage even when the legitimate link is trained only for its own task.

In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth.

While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure.

We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.","authors":["Gang Liao","Hongsen Qin","Ying Wang","Alicia Golden","Michael Kuchnik","Yavuz Yetim","Jia Jiunn Ang","Chunli Fu","Yihan He","Samuel Hsia","Zewei Jiang","Dianshi Li","Uladzimir Pashkevich","Varna Puvvada","Feng Shi","Matt Steiner","Ruichao Xiao","Nathan Yan","Xiayu Yu","Zhou Fang","Abdul Zainul-Abedin","Ketan Singh","Hongtao Yu","Wenyuan Chi","Barney Huang","Sean Zhang","Noah Weller","Zach Marine","Wyatt Cook","Carole-Jean Wu","Gaoxiang Liu"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24443v1","updated":"2025-12-30T19:53:50Z","published":"2025-12-30T19:53:50Z","title":"Sparse classification with positive-confidence data in high dimensions","summary":"High-dimensional learning problems, where the number of features exceeds the sample size, often require sparse regularization for effective prediction and variable selection. While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve predictive performance and variable selection accuracy comparable to fully supervised approaches, effectively bridging the gap between weak supervision and high-dimensional statistics.","authors":["The Tien Mai","Mai Anh Nguyen","Trung Nghia Nguyen"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02987v3","updated":"2025-12-30T19:51:20Z","published":"2025-05-05T19:33:48Z","title":"New affine invariant ensemble samplers and their dimensional scaling","summary":"We introduce new affine invariant ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers that are easy to construct and improve upon existing methods, especially for high-dimensional problems.

Here, we adapt tools from interpretability research in Large Language Models to analyze intermediate computational layers in GraphCast, leveraging sparse autoencoders to discover interpretable features in the neuron space of the model. We uncover distinct features on a wide range of length and time scales that correspond to tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, diurnal and seasonal behavior, large-scale precipitation patterns, specific geographical coding, and sea-ice extent, among others. We further demonstrate how the precise abstraction of these features can be probed via interventions on the prediction steps of the model. As a case study, we sparsely modify a feature corresponding to tropical cyclones in GraphCast and observe interpretable and physically consistent modifications to evolving hurricanes. Such methods offer a window into the black-box behavior of data-driven physics models and are a step towards realizing their potential as trustworthy predictors and scientifically valuable tools for discovery.","authors":["Theodore MacMillan","Nicholas T.

Most practical MU algorithms are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically. Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model training. We illustrate that this is particularly relevant for MU methods that are deterministic, i.e., which always produce the same result when started from the same trained model.

Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs' privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs' internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods.

Specifically, (i) deploying LLMs on local devices faces computational, memory, and energy resource issues, while (ii) deploying them in the cloud cannot guarantee real-time service and incurs communication/usage costs. In this paper, we design TMO, a local-cloud LLM inference system with Three-M Offloading: Multi-modal, Multi-task, and Multi-dialogue. TMO incorporates (i) a lightweight local LLM that can process simple tasks at high speed and (ii) a large-scale cloud LLM that can handle multi-modal data sources.

We also contribute M4A1, a new dataset we curated that contains reward and cost metrics across multiple modality, task, dialogue, and LLM configurations, enabling evaluation of offloading decisions.

Under the assumption that velocity and/or scalar fields are measured, our approach infers unknown closure terms in the governing equations as neural networks. The target to be discovered is the constitutive relations only, while the temporal derivative, convective transport terms, and pressure-gradient term in the governing equations are prescribed. The formulation is rooted in a variational principle from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where the dynamics is defined by a free-energy functional and a dissipation functional. The unknown constitutive terms arise as functional derivatives of these functionals with respect to the state variables. To enable a flexible and structured model discovery, the free-energy and dissipation functionals are parameterized using neural networks, while their functional derivatives are obtained via automatic differentiation. This construction enforces thermodynamic consistency by design, guaranteeing monotonic decay of the total free energy and non-negative entropy production. The resulting method, termed GIMLET (Generalizable and Interpretable Model Learning through Embedded Thermodynamics), avoids reliance on a predefined library of candidate functions, unlike sparse regression or symbolic identification approaches. The learned models are generalizable in that functionals identified from one dataset can be transferred to distinct datasets governed by the same underlying equations. Moreover, the inferred free-energy and dissipation functions provide direct physical interpretability of the learned dynamics. The framework is demonstrated on several benchmark systems, including the viscous Burgers equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.","authors":["Suguru Shiratori","Elham Kiyani","Khemraj Shukla","George Em Karniadakis"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11450v2","updated":"2025-12-30T18:46:40Z","published":"2020-10-22T05:19:58Z","title":"Optimal Approximation -- Smoothness Tradeoffs for Soft-Max Functions","summary":"A soft-max function has two main efficiency measures: (1) approximation - which corresponds to how well it approximates the maximum function, (2) smoothness - which shows how sensitive it is to changes of its input.

This leads to novel soft-max functions, each of which is optimal for a different application. The most commonly used soft-max function, called exponential mechanism, has optimal tradeoff between approximation measured in terms of expected additive approximation and smoothness measured with respect to Rényi Divergence.

We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency.

This new training procedure is underpinned by our two main theoretical results.\n  For 4-dimensional Brownian motion, we show that LévyGAN exhibits state-of-the-art performance across several metrics which measure both the joint and marginal distributions. We conclude with a numerical experiment on the log-Heston model, a popular SDE in mathematical finance, demonstrating that high-quality synthetic Lévy area can lead to high order weak convergence and variance reduction when using multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC).","authors":["Andraž Jelinčič","Jiajie Tao","William F.

To this end, we achieve the compression rate as 0.02% at some cases by introducing Generative Video Compression (GVC), a new framework that redefines the limits of video compression by leveraging modern generative video models to achieve extreme compression rates while preserving a perception-centric, task-oriented communication paradigm, corresponding to Level C of the Shannon-Weaver model. Besides, How we trade computation for compression rate or bandwidth? GVC answers this question by shifting the burden from transmission to inference: it encodes video into extremely compact representations and delegates content reconstruction to the receiver, where powerful generative priors synthesize high-quality video from minimal transmitted information. Is GVC practical and deployable? To ensure practical deployment, we propose a compression-computation trade-off strategy, enabling fast inference on consume-grade GPUs. Within the AI Flow framework, GVC opens new possibility for video communication in bandwidth- and resource-constrained environments such as emergency rescue, remote surveillance, and mobile edge computing. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that GVC offers a viable path toward a new effective, efficient, scalable, and practical video communication paradigm.","authors":["Xiangyu Chen","Jixiang Luo","Jingyu Xu","Fangqiu Yi","Chi Zhang","Xuelong Li"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24276v1","updated":"2025-12-30T15:03:38Z","published":"2025-12-30T15:03:38Z","title":"LiftProj: Space Lifting and Projection-Based Panorama Stitching","summary":"Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.","authors":["Yuan Jia","Ruimin Wu","Rui Song","Jiaojiao Li","Bin Song"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"16 pages, 10 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13142v5","updated":"2025-12-30T13:32:42Z","published":"2025-08-18T17:55:17Z","title":"Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs on Spatial Intelligence","summary":"Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence (SI). We thus propose EASI for holistic Evaluation of multimodAl LLMs on Spatial Intelligence. EASI conceptualizes a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a growing collection of newly curated ones, enabling systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models. In this report, we conduct the study across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in SI, yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail the most advanced multimodal models. EASI is an ongoing community effort: we have open-sourced the EASI codebase that provides a one-stop and reproducible solution with standardized interfaces, integrated protocols and prompts that significantly reduce the friction of configuring and running multiple benchmarks; we have also launched an accompanying EASI leaderboard to provide a continually updated snapshot of model performance across the full SI spectrum, accelerating collective progress toward robust SI.","authors":["Zhongang Cai","Yubo Wang","Qingping Sun","Ruisi Wang","Chenyang Gu","Wanqi Yin","Zhiqian Lin","Zhitao Yang","Chen Wei","Oscar Qian","Hui En Pang","Xuanke Shi","Kewang Deng","Xiaoyang Han","Zukai Chen","Jiaqi Li","Xiangyu Fan","Hanming Deng","Lewei Lu","Bo Li","Ziwei Liu","Quan Wang","Dahua Lin","Lei Yang"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"Codebase: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/EASI/ ; Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmms-lab-si/EASI-Leaderboard"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13719v3","updated":"2025-12-30T13:07:56Z","published":"2025-11-17T18:59:33Z","title":"Scaling Spatial Intelligence with Multimodal Foundation Models","summary":"Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence.

We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a \"grounding then answering with evidence referencing\" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding.

However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.","authors":["Suyan Dai","Gan Sun","Fazeng Li","Xu Tang","Qianqian Wang","Yang Cong"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24064v1","updated":"2025-12-30T08:19:07Z","published":"2025-12-30T08:19:07Z","title":"Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels for Cross-Modal Retrieval","summary":"In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.","authors":["Yizhi Liu","Ruitao Pu","Shilin Xu","Yingke Chen","Quan-Hui Liu","Yuan Sun"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"9 pages, 4 figures, and AAAI-26 conference"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24052v1","updated":"2025-12-30T07:52:17Z","published":"2025-12-30T07:52:17Z","title":"AHA: Aligning Large Audio-Language Models for Reasoning Hallucinations via Counterfactual Hard Negatives","summary":"Although Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) deliver state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, they frequently suffer from hallucinations, e.g. generating text not grounded in the audio input.

We define language models capable of such tri-modal processing as the omni-language models (OLMs). OmniBench is distinguished by high-quality human annotations, ensuring that accurate responses require integrated understanding and reasoning across all three modalities. Our main findings reveal that: i) open-source OLMs exhibit critical limitations in instruction-following and reasoning capabilities within tri-modal contexts; and ii) most baselines models perform poorly (below 50% accuracy) even when provided with alternative textual representations of images or/and audio. These results suggest that the ability to construct a consistent context from text, image, and audio is often overlooked in existing MLLM training paradigms. To address this gap, we curate an instruction tuning dataset of 84.5K training samples, OmniInstruct, for training OLMs to adapt to tri-modal contexts.

To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time.

Notably, its performance gains increase as the sequence length grows, highlighting its potential for long-context applications.","authors":["Mahdi Karami","Ali Behrouz","Praneeth Kacham","Vahab Mirrokni"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"In Second Conference on Language Modeling (COLM) (2025)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850v1","updated":"2025-12-29T20:29:09Z","published":"2025-12-29T20:29:09Z","title":"The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models","summary":"Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.","authors":["Rahul Baxi"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"Currently under review at TMLR"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23848v1","updated":"2025-12-29T20:24:15Z","published":"2025-12-29T20:24:15Z","title":"Integrating Domain Knowledge for Financial QA: A Multi-Retriever RAG Approach with LLMs","summary":"This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss.

We evaluate whether tokens extracted from intermediate layers can serve as effective adversarial perturbations for downstream evaluation tasks. We conduct experiments on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset, with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B serving as both the generator and evaluator. Our results show that attention-based adversarial examples lead to measurable drops in evaluation performance while remaining semantically similar to the original inputs. However, we also observe that substitutions drawn from certain layers and token positions can introduce grammatical degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness.

We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error. This finding highlights the need for further research into enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively decline requests when faced with inadequate information.","authors":["Dingmin Wang","Ji Ma","Shankar Kumar"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23835v1","updated":"2025-12-29T19:58:11Z","published":"2025-12-29T19:58:11Z","title":"Explaining News Bias Detection: A Comparative SHAP Analysis of Transformer Model Decision Mechanisms","summary":"Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.","authors":["Himel Ghosh"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"10 pages, 8 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07805v2","updated":"2025-12-29T19:36:21Z","published":"2025-12-08T18:39:13Z","title":"Group Representational Position Encoding","summary":"We present GRAPE (Group RepresentAtional Position Encoding), a unified framework for positional encoding based on group actions. GRAPE brings together two families of mechanisms: (i) multiplicative rotations (Multiplicative GRAPE) in $\\mathrm{SO}(d)$ and (ii) additive logit biases (Additive GRAPE) arising from unipotent actions in the general linear group $\\mathrm{GL}$. In Multiplicative GRAPE, a position $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (or $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$) acts as $\\mathbf{G}(n)=\\exp(n\\,ω\\,\\mathbf{L})$ with a rank-2 skew generator $\\mathbf{L} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$, yielding a relative, compositional, norm-preserving map with a closed-form matrix exponential.

Learned commuting subspaces and compact non-commuting mixtures strictly extend this geometry to capture cross-subspace feature coupling at $O(d)$ and $O(r d)$ cost per head, respectively. In Additive GRAPE, additive logits arise as rank-1 (or low-rank) unipotent actions, recovering ALiBi and the Forgetting Transformer (FoX) as exact special cases while preserving an exact relative law and streaming cacheability. Altogether, GRAPE supplies a principled design space for positional geometry in long-context models, subsuming RoPE and ALiBi as special cases.

A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.","authors":["Shashwat Goel","Rishi Hazra","Dulhan Jayalath","Timon Willi","Parag Jain","William F.

Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks.","authors":["Jing Huang","Shujian Zhang","Lun Wang","Andrew Hard","Rajiv Mathews","John Lambert"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23693v1","updated":"2025-12-29T18:51:56Z","published":"2025-12-29T18:51:56Z","title":"Fine-Tuning LLMs with Fine-Grained Human Feedback on Text Spans","summary":"We present a method and dataset for fine-tuning language models with preference supervision using feedback-driven improvement chains.

We construct preference pairs for direct alignment from each adjacent step in the chain, enabling the model to learn from localized, targeted edits.

Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration.

Understanding public attitudes toward marriage requires examining not only emotional sentiment but also the moral reasoning underlying these evaluations. This study analyzed 219,358 marriage-related posts from two major Chinese social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Xiaohongshu) using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral dimensions (Autonomy, Community, Divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo discourse skewed positive, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts across both platforms lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral ethics were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged.

In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of GPT-4o for rare disease NER under low-resource settings, using a range of prompt-based strategies including zero-shot prompting, few-shot in-context learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and task-level fine-tuning. We design a structured prompting framework that encodes domain-specific knowledge and disambiguation rules for four entity types. We further introduce two semantically guided few-shot example selection methods to improve in-context performance while reducing labeling effort. Experiments on the RareDis Corpus show that GPT-4o achieves competitive or superior performance compared to BioClinicalBERT, with task-level fine-tuning yielding the strongest performance among the evaluated approaches and improving upon the previously reported BioClinicalBERT baseline. Cost-performance analysis reveals that few-shot prompting delivers high returns at low token budgets. RAG provides limited overall gains but can improve recall for challenging entity types, especially signs and symptoms. An error taxonomy highlights common failure modes such as boundary drift and type confusion, suggesting opportunities for post-processing and hybrid refinement. Our results demonstrate that prompt-optimized LLMs can serve as effective, scalable alternatives to traditional supervised models in biomedical NER, particularly in rare disease applications where annotated data is scarce.","authors":["Nan Miles Xi","Yu Deng","Lin Wang"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23578v1","updated":"2025-12-29T16:23:54Z","published":"2025-12-29T16:23:54Z","title":"Style Amnesia: Investigating Speaking Style Degradation and Mitigation in Multi-Turn Spoken Language Models","summary":"In this paper, we show that when spoken language models (SLMs) are instructed to speak in a specific speaking style at the beginning of a multi-turn conversation, they cannot maintain the required speaking styles after several turns of interaction; we refer to this as the style amnesia of SLMs. We focus on paralinguistic speaking styles, including emotion, accent, volume, and speaking speed. We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia. In addition, we examine various prompting strategies and find that SLMs struggle to follow the required style when the instruction is placed in system messages rather than user messages, which contradicts the intended function of system prompts.","authors":["Yu-Xiang Lin","Cheng-Han Chiang","Hung-yi Lee"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"Work in progress"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01516v2","updated":"2025-12-29T16:20:38Z","published":"2025-01-02T19:49:04Z","title":"Quantifying True Robustness: Synonymity-Weighted Similarity for Trustworthy XAI Evaluation","summary":"Adversarial attacks challenge the reliability of Explainable AI (XAI) by altering explanations while the model's output remains unchanged.

To address this, we apply synonymity weighting, a method that amends these measures by incorporating the semantic similarity of perturbed words. This produces more accurate vulnerability assessments and provides an important tool for assessing the robustness of AI systems. Our approach prevents the overestimation of attack success, leading to a more faithful understanding of an XAI system's true resilience against adversarial manipulation.","authors":["Christopher Burger"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"10 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables.

The pipeline is implemented and evaluated in the state-of-the-art OM system Agent-OM.

These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models.

In this paper, we address a more practical scenario: topic-oriented adversarial opinion manipulation attacks on RAG models, where LLMs are required to reason and synthesize multiple perspectives, rendering them particularly susceptible to systematic knowledge poisoning. Specifically, we propose Topic-FlipRAG, a two-stage manipulation attack pipeline that strategically crafts adversarial perturbations to influence opinions across related queries. This approach combines traditional adversarial ranking attack techniques and leverages the extensive internal relevant knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to execute semantic-level perturbations. Experiments show that the proposed attacks effectively shift the opinion of the model's outputs on specific topics, significantly impacting user information perception.

However, like other neural architectures, they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations: subtle character-, word-, or phrase-level perturbations can poison retrieval results and artificially promote targeted candidates, undermining the integrity of search engines and downstream systems. Existing defenses either rely on heuristics with poor generalization or on certified methods that assume overly strong adversarial knowledge, limiting their practical use. To address these challenges, we propose RobustMask, a novel defense that combines the context-prediction capability of pretrained language models with a randomized masking-based smoothing mechanism. Our approach strengthens neural ranking models against adversarial perturbations at the character, word, and phrase levels. Leveraging both the pairwise comparison ability of ranking models and probabilistic statistical analysis, we provide a theoretical proof of RobustMask's certified top-K robustness. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that RobustMask successfully certifies over 20% of candidate documents within the top-10 ranking positions against adversarial perturbations affecting up to 30% of their content. These results highlight the effectiveness of RobustMask in enhancing the adversarial robustness of neural ranking models, marking a significant step toward providing stronger security guarantees for real-world retrieval systems.","authors":["Jiawei Liu","Zhuo Chen","Rui Zhu","Miaokun Chen","Yuyang Gong","Wei Lu","Xiaofeng Wang"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00968v2","updated":"2025-12-29T06:38:38Z","published":"2025-11-30T16:31:16Z","title":"Optimizing Generative Ranking Relevance via Reinforcement Learning in Xiaohongshu Search","summary":"Ranking relevance is a fundamental task in search engines, aiming to identify the items most relevant to a given user query. Traditional relevance models typically produce scalar scores or directly predict relevance labels, limiting both interpretability and the modeling of complex relevance signals. Inspired by recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for complex tasks, we investigate whether explicit reasoning can enhance both interpretability and performance in relevance modeling. However, existing reasoning-based Generative Relevance Models (GRMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning on large amounts of human-annotated or synthetic CoT data, which often leads to limited generalization. Moreover, domain-agnostic, free-form reasoning tends to be overly generic and insufficiently grounded, limiting its potential to handle the diverse and ambiguous cases prevalent in open-domain search. In this work, we formulate relevance modeling in Xiaohongshu search as a reasoning task and introduce a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework to enhance the grounded reasoning capabilities of GRMs. Specifically, we incorporate practical business-specific relevance criteria into the multi-step reasoning prompt design and propose Stepwise Advantage Masking (SAM), a lightweight process-supervision strategy which facilitates effective learning of these criteria through improved credit assignment. To enable industrial deployment, we further distill the large-scale RL-tuned model to a lightweight version suitable for real-world search systems. Extensive offline evaluations and online A/B tests demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers significant improvements across key relevance and business metrics, validating its effectiveness, robustness, and practicality for large-scale industrial search systems.","authors":["Ziyang Zeng","Heming Jing","Jindong Chen","Xiangli Li","Hongyu Liu","Yixuan He","Zhengyu Li","Yige Sun","Zheyong Xie","Yuqing Yang","Shaosheng Cao","Jun Fan","Yi Wu","Yao Hu"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"Accepted to the ADS Track at KDD 2026"}],"Multimedia":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23688v1","updated":"2025-12-29T18:44:59Z","published":"2025-12-29T18:44:59Z","title":"Unlocking WebRTC for End User Driven Innovation","summary":"We present a software architecture to enable end user driven innovation of web multimedia communication applications.

This architecture employs a two-stage process: first, it selects expert networks that perform well in specific categories from a pool of candidate networks using a greedy algorithm; second, it integrates the segmentation predictions of these selected networks by adaptively weighting their contributions based on their segmentation performance in each category. Inspired by Conditional Random Field (CRF), the ClassWise-CRF architecture treats the segmentation predictions from multiple networks as confidence vector fields. It leverages segmentation metrics (such as Intersection over Union) from the validation set as priors and employs an exponential weighting strategy to fuse the category-specific confidence scores predicted by each network. This fusion method dynamically adjusts the weights of each network for different categories, achieving category-specific optimization. Building on this, the architecture further optimizes the fused results using unary and pairwise potentials in CRF to ensure spatial consistency and boundary accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of ClassWise-CRF, we conducted experiments on two remote sensing datasets, LoveDA and Vaihingen, using eight classic and advanced semantic segmentation networks. The results show that the ClassWise-CRF architecture significantly improves segmentation performance: on the LoveDA dataset, the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric increased by 1.00% on the validation set and by 0.68% on the test set; on the Vaihingen dataset, the mIoU improved by 0.87% on the validation set and by 0.91% on the test set.

SonicMaster is conditioned on natural language instructions to apply targeted enhancements, or can operate in an automatic mode for general restoration. To train this model, we construct the SonicMaster dataset, a large dataset of paired degraded and high-quality tracks by simulating common degradation types with nineteen degradation functions belonging to five enhancements groups: equalization, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, and stereo. Our approach leverages a flow-matching generative training paradigm to learn an audio transformation that maps degraded inputs to their cleaned, mastered versions guided by text prompts. Objective audio quality metrics demonstrate that SonicMaster significantly improves sound quality across all artifact categories. Furthermore, subjective listening tests confirm that listeners prefer SonicMaster's enhanced outputs over other baselines.","authors":["Jan Melechovsky","Ambuj Mehrish","Abhinaba Roy","Dorien Herremans"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10704v2","updated":"2025-12-27T09:09:30Z","published":"2025-03-12T15:32:44Z","title":"Error Analyses of Auto-Regressive Video Diffusion Models: A Unified Framework","summary":"Auto-Regressive Video Diffusion Models (AR-VDMs) have shown strong capabilities in generating long, photorealistic videos, but suffer from two key limitations: (i) history forgetting, where the model loses track of previously generated content, and (ii) temporal degradation, where frame quality deteriorates over time. Yet a rigorous theoretical analysis of these phenomena is lacking, and existing empirical understanding remains insufficiently grounded. In this paper, we introduce Meta-ARVDM, a unified analytical framework that studies both errors through the shared autoregressive structure of AR-VDMs. We show that history forgetting is characterized by the conditional mutual information between the generated output and preceding frames, conditioned on inputs, and prove that incorporating more past frames monotonically alleviates history forgetting, thereby theoretically justifying a common belief in existing works. Moreover, our theory reveals that standard metrics fail to capture this effect, motivating a new evaluation protocol based on a ``needle-in-a-haystack'' task in closed-ended environments (DMLab and Minecraft). We further show that temporal degradation can be quantified by the cumulative sum of per-step errors, enabling prediction of degradation for different schedulers without video rollout. Finally, our evaluation uncovers a strong empirical correlation between history forgetting and temporal degradation, a connection not previously reported.","authors":["Jing Wang","Fengzhuo Zhang","Xiaoli Li","Vincent Y.

However, differences in user profiles and video content lead to different weights for QoE factors, resulting in user-specific QoE functions and, thus, varying optimization objectives. This variability poses significant challenges for neural networks, as they often struggle to generalize under evolving targets - a phenomenon known as plasticity loss that prevents conventional models from adapting effectively to changing optimization objectives. To address this limitation, we propose the Plasticity-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE), a novel learning framework that dynamically modulates network plasticity by balancing memory retention with selective forgetting. In particular, PA-MoE leverages noise injection to promote the selective forgetting of outdated knowledge, thereby endowing neural networks with enhanced adaptive capabilities. In addition, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of PA-MoE by deriving a regret bound that quantifies its learning performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that PA-MoE achieves a 45.5% improvement in QoE over competitive baselines in dynamic streaming environments. Further analysis reveals that the model effectively mitigates plasticity loss by optimizing neuron utilization. Finally, a parameter sensitivity study is performed by injecting varying levels of noise, and the results align closely with our theoretical predictions.","authors":["Zhiqiang He","Zhi Liu"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null}]},"2025-12-26T00:00:00Z":{"Information Retrieval":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22396v1","updated":"2025-12-26T22:16:12Z","published":"2025-12-26T22:16:12Z","title":"HalluMat: Detecting Hallucinations in LLM-Generated Materials Science Content Through Multi-Stage Verification","summary":"Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming scientific discovery, enabling rapid knowledge generation and hypothesis formulation.

In this study, we introduce Laser, a general framework for stabilizing and scaling agentic search. Laser defines a symbolic action protocol that organizes agent behaviors into three spaces: planning, task-solving, and retrospection. Each action is specified with explicit semantics and a deterministic execution format, enabling structured and logical reasoning processes and reliable action parsing. This design makes intermediate decisions interpretable and traceable, enhancing explicit retrospection and fine-grained control over reasoning trajectories. In coordination with parsable actions, Laser further maintains a compact context register that stores only essential states of the reasoning process, allowing the agent to reason over long horizons without uncontrolled context expansion.

The Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) methods modeled by the dual-tower network are widely used in the industry to maintain both retrieval efficiency and accuracy. However, the dual-tower model has significant limitations: the embeddings of users and ads interact only at the final inner product computation, resulting in insufficient feature interaction capabilities. Although DNN-based models with both user and ad as input features, allowing for early-stage interaction between these features, are introduced in the ranking stage to mitigate this issue, they are computationally infeasible for the retrieval stage. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an efficient GPU-based feature interaction for the dual-tower network to significantly improve retrieval accuracy while substantially reducing computational costs. Specifically, we introduce a novel compressed inverted list designed for GPU acceleration, enabling efficient feature interaction computation at scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework in the industry to successfully implement Wide and Deep in a retrieval system. We apply this model to the real-world business scenarios in Tencent Advertising, and experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluation and has been successfully deployed to Tencent's advertising recommendation system, delivering significant online performance gains.

However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users.

To address these challenges, we propose LLM-I2I, a data-centric framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate data quality issues. LLM-I2I includes (1) an LLM-based generator that synthesizes user-item interactions for long-tail items, alleviating data sparsity, and (2) an LLM-based discriminator that filters noisy interactions from real and synthetic data. The refined data is then fused to train I2I models. Evaluated on industry (AEDS) and academic (ARD) datasets, LLM-I2I consistently improves recommendation accuracy, particularly for long-tail items. Deployed on a large-scale cross-border e-commerce platform, it boosts recall number (RN) by 6.02% and gross merchandise value (GMV) by 1.22% over existing I2I models. This work highlights the potential of LLMs in enhancing data-centric recommendation systems without modifying model architectures.","authors":["Yinfu Feng","Yanjing Wu","Rong Xiao","Xiaoyi Zen"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09109v3","updated":"2025-12-25T08:50:33Z","published":"2025-11-12T08:29:39Z","title":"Thinking Forward and Backward: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning","summary":"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.

Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.","authors":["Wenda Wei","Yu-An Liu","Ruqing Zhang","Jiafeng Guo","Lixin Su","Shuaiqiang Wang","Dawei Yin","Maarten de Rijke","Xueqi Cheng"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21543v1","updated":"2025-12-25T07:28:35Z","published":"2025-12-25T07:28:35Z","title":"CEMG: Collaborative-Enhanced Multimodal Generative Recommendation","summary":"Generative recommendation models often struggle with two key challenges: (1) the superficial integration of collaborative signals, and (2) the decoupled fusion of multimodal features.

Standalone LLM recommender are costly, biased, and unreliable across large regions of the user item space, while global distillation forces the downstream model to imitate LLM predictions even when such guidance is inaccurate. Meanwhile, recent studies show that LLMs excel particularly in re-ranking and challenging scenarios, rather than uniformly across all contexts.We introduce Selective LLM Guided Regularization, a model-agnostic and computation efficient framework that activates LLM based pairwise ranking supervision only when a trainable gating mechanism informing by user history length, item popularity, and model uncertainty predicts the LLM to be reliable.

This research attempts to provide managerial guidelines for cooperative advertising in the SEA context by modeling two cooperative advertising decision scenarios. Scenario I defines a simple cooperative channel consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. In Scenario II, we consider a more general setting where there is an independent retailer who competes with the Manufacturer-Retailer alliance in Scenario I. We propose a novel cooperative advertising optimization model, wherein a manufacturer can advertise product directly through SEA campaigns and indirectly by subsidizing its retailer. To highlight the distinctive features of SEA, our model incorporates dynamic quality scores and focuses on a finite time horizon. In each scenario, we provide a feasible equilibrium solution of optimal policies for all members. Subsequently, we conduct numerical experiments to perform sensitivity analysis for both the quality score and gross margin. Additionally, we explore the impact of the initial market share of the competing retailer in Scenario II.

While existing research mainly targets RAG's performance and efficiency, emerging studies highlight critical security concerns. Yet, current adversarial approaches remain limited, mostly addressing white-box scenarios or heuristic black-box attacks without fully investigating vulnerabilities in the retrieval phase. Additionally, prior works mainly focus on factoid Q&A tasks, their attacks lack complexity and can be easily corrected by advanced LLMs. In this paper, we investigate a more realistic and critical threat scenario: adversarial attacks intended for opinion manipulation against black-box RAG models, particularly on controversial topics. Specifically, we propose FlippedRAG, a transfer-based adversarial attack against black-box RAG systems. We first demonstrate that the underlying retriever of a black-box RAG system can be reverse-engineered, enabling us to train a surrogate retriever. Leveraging the surrogate retriever, we further craft target poisoning triggers, altering vary few documents to effectively manipulate both retrieval and subsequent generation. Extensive empirical results show that FlippedRAG substantially outperforms baseline methods, improving the average attack success rate by 16.7%. FlippedRAG achieves on average a 50% directional shift in the opinion polarity of RAG-generated responses, ultimately causing a notable 20% shift in user cognition. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of several potential defensive measures, concluding that existing mitigation strategies remain insufficient against such sophisticated manipulation attacks. These results highlight an urgent need for developing innovative defensive solutions to ensure the security and trustworthiness of RAG systems.","authors":["Zhuo Chen","Yuyang Gong","Jiawei Liu","Miaokun Chen","Haotan Liu","Qikai Cheng","Fan Zhang","Wei Lu","Xiaozhong Liu"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"Accepted by 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2025)"}],"Multimedia":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21698v1","updated":"2025-12-25T14:48:09Z","published":"2025-12-25T14:48:09Z","title":"Raster Domain Text Steganography: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Secure Embedding","summary":"This work introduces a unified raster domain steganographic framework, termed as the Glyph Perturbation Cardinality (GPC) framework, capable of embedding heterogeneous data such as text, images, audio, and video directly into the pixel space of rendered textual glyphs. Unlike linguistic or structural text based steganography, the proposed method operates exclusively after font rasterization, modifying only the bitmap produced by a deterministic text rendering pipeline. Each glyph functions as a covert encoding unit, where a payload value is expressed through the cardinality of minimally perturbed interior ink pixels. These minimal intensity increments remain visually imperceptible while forming a stable and decodable signal. The framework is demonstrated for text to text embedding and generalized to multimodal inputs by normalizing image intensities, audio derived scalar features, and video frame values into bounded integer sequences distributed across glyphs. Decoding is achieved by re-rasterizing the cover text, subtracting canonical glyph rasters, and recovering payload values via pixel count analysis. The approach is computationally lightweight, and grounded in deterministic raster behavior, enabling ordinary text to serve as a visually covert medium for multimodal data embedding.","authors":["A V Uday Kiran Kandala"],"pdf_url":"","comment":null}]},"2025-12-24T00:00:00Z":{"Information Retrieval":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10688v5","updated":"2025-12-24T17:12:02Z","published":"2025-12-11T14:35:13Z","title":"Rethinking Popularity Bias in Collaborative Filtering via Analytical Vector Decomposition","summary":"Popularity bias fundamentally undermines the personalization capabilities of collaborative filtering (CF) models, causing them to disproportionately recommend popular items while neglecting users' genuine preferences for niche content. While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that BPR systematically organizes item embeddings along a dominant \"popularity direction\" where embedding magnitudes directly correlate with interaction frequency. This geometric distortion forces user embeddings to simultaneously handle two conflicting tasks-expressing genuine preference and calibrating against global popularity-trapping them in suboptimal configurations that favor popular items regardless of individual tastes. We propose Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC), a universally applicable framework that surgically corrects this embedding geometry through asymmetric directional updates. DDC guides positive interactions along personalized preference directions while steering negative interactions away from the global popularity direction, disentangling preference from popularity at the geometric source. Extensive experiments across multiple BPR-based architectures demonstrate that DDC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing methods, reducing training loss to less than 5% of heavily-tuned baselines while achieving superior recommendation quality and fairness.

This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.\n  In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units.

Experiments on 6K-resolution videos show that NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and a 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, a representative prior work, while delivering better image quality in terms of objective metrics.","authors":["Daichi Arai","Kyohei Unno","Yasuko Sugito","Yuichi Kusakabe"],"pdf_url":"","comment":"2026 IIEEJ International Conference on Image Electronics and Visual Computing (IEVC)"}]}}
